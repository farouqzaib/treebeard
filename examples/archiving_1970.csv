I—Shehu Laminu of /Bornu

By

W. K. R..HALLam '

HE man who was to become known to the
world as Shehu Laminu or simply as al-
Kanemi was born in Kanem east of Lake Chad in
1778. His full name was Muhammad al-Amin
ibn Muhammad al-Kanemi. His father was
Sheikh Ninga of the Kuburi Borguwa of Northern
Kanem and his mother was the daughter of Abdul
Zalil, the son of Sheikh Muhammad al-Nafarawt
of Zeila in the Fezzan. Sheikh Ninga was a
renowned faki and scholar who resided _mainly
in the Fezzan where he had a large collection of
learned books and treatises which was still in
existence in Murzuk at the turn of the last century.
The antecedents of the young man who was to
become the saviour of Bornu were thus both noble
and cultured and there is no doubt that he obtained
the pious and learned disposition which was to
characterize his whole life from the upbringing he
received as a young lad. He spent his early youth
with his father in the Fezzan and then, when still
in his teens, went to Mecca on pilgrimage and
remained there studying for five years. From
Mecca he moved to Cairo for five years and whilst
there he no doubt encountered at al-Azhar
University students who had come from Bornu.
Since 1242 A.D. there had been a Bornu hostel
known as Jbn Rashiq in Cairo for the use of pil-
grims and students and there had long been con-
tact between the intelligentsia of Egypt and that of
Bornu.

From Cairo al-Kanemi travelled to Fez, another
centre of Muslim learning, and sojourned there for
_ three years before returning home. Although
Sheikh Ninga lived in the Fezzan he had retained
close connections with the land of his birth
which was separated from the Fezzan by the
Tibesti Mountains and the great sand sea lying to

their west. The normal route of trans-Saharan
communication was the ancient Garamantian
Road ending on the northern banks of Lake
Chad. This route had been in use over the ages
by Romans, Berber refugees and merchants and
pilgrims and was soon to see the Scottish explorer
Clapperton and his party, the first of the European
visitors to Bornu.

Now al-Kanemi travelled down this road and
settled in Kanem. This sparsely populated area
was not a land where scholars abounded and al-
Kanemi, with his background, was far in advance
of any learned men or fakis who were there.
Before long his learning and piety made him
renowned throughout the land and he became
widely known for the miraculous cures which he
affected as well as his writing of religious prescrip-
tions. This gave him great influence, an influence
which he was later to use with telling effect.

Bornu by this time was situated west of Lake
Chad whence the court had moved in 1390 A.D.,
abandoning Kanem to the Bulala whose pressure
the Bornu army was at that time unable to with-
stand. A century later the great Idrisid Mai or
King, Ali Gaji, built a new capital Birni Gazar-
gamu near the Yobe river which flows into the
northern waters of Lake Chad. This walled city
held nearly a quarter of a million people within its
six square miles and was the seat of the Bornu Mais
and their Kanuri aristocracy. The Bornu rulers
carried back their line unbroken for a thousand
years, back to the time when their court had
first emerged in Kanem as a nomad aristocracy
said to have descended from the great Yemeni
patriot Saif ibn Dthi Yazan, himself a descendant
of the Tubba al-Awal dynasty of Himyaritic kings.
The nomad Mais, from a beginning which pro-

when they go out into the bush to cut grass or hay
for their Chief’s horses. It is after their return
that the dance commences at the Palace.

At the end of the ceremony the leader of the
gtoup is presented with a pair of decorated trousers
and a whip to maintain discipline among the
dancers.

One important aspect of the traditional dance is
that no other person is allowed to take part other
than those living within the area. An outsider
Could take part after receiving special invitation
from the Chief.

So fascinating was the dance of this particular
. §toup that they made it a double this year by
Winning the Emir of Dikwa’s Cup for Music and

By a

tf

A. N. SKINNER

Centre for Nigerian Languages is being set
up as part of Abdullahi Bayero College, Kano.

It is intended that this will, among other things, take

over and develop the work of the former Hausa

Language Board. At present it is financed by a grant

made by Kano State and its staff consists of a full-

time secretary. A Hausa typist will shortly be added.

However, the three members of the Bayero College

Faculty involved in the teaching of Hausa are also

assisting in its work. On the other hand due to short-

age of staff, most of the secretary’s time is now devoted

_ to teaching.

The following projects have already been started:

1. Bibliography of Hausa Studies; through the kind-
ness of Mr Paul Lovejoy, the Centre has been
given or lent a large number of indexed cards
which will form the core of such a bibliography.
These are being copied or filed;

2. Reprint of Bargery’s Dictionary; this is being
considered by Greggs Publishers and UNESCO,
and the Centre is preparing an appendix of
additional words and amendments, in particular
neologisms that have entered the language from
English and French since 1930;

3. A revised edition of the Hausa Language Board’s
English-Hausa Dictionary. has been prepared
and is to be published by North Nigerian Pub-
lishing Co., Zaria;

4. A small collection of poetry has been made both
in manuscript and on tape and this is being tran-

_ liscribed and indexed;
s. Anumber of leading persons concerned with and
interested in the Hausa language have been
invited to become members of the Advisory
Committee on the Hausa. language, and regular
meetings of this Committee have been held;

6. Liaison with the UNESCO Research Centre in

""Niamey has been established. and support (with
both equipment, finance and taped material)
received;

30

7. A prize for the best Hausa short story written by a
student of Bayero College this session has been
awarded and is to be published.

Policy and plans for the future will, of course, depend
on. the financial support available and the staff that the
Centre is able to employ. But it seems that the Centre
might serve to stimulate, to encourage co-operation
and to provide information and facilities to scholars,
publishers and writers; and make suggestions for the
standardization of orthography.

In pursyance of such a policy, it is suggested that while
the following are needed, perhaps urgently needed if
the- policies of States envisage increased teaching of
vernaculars, it is not within the bounds of reason-
able possibility for the Centre to produce them all.
What is possible is for the Centre to encourage publishers
and writers to undertake them; to ask States to support
and recommend their use in schools; to read man-
uscripts for publishers and to advise ort orthography;
and perhaps to offer encouragement to writers in the
shape of regular competitions and prizes; to hold short
courses and seminars; also, of course, to welcome and
assist scholars, Nigerian and visiting, in any way
possible:

1. A Hausa-Hausa dictionary;

2. A Hausa grammar, in Hausa, for primary schools

i.€., a rewriting of the very unsatisfactory Hausa a

Sauk’ ak’e;

3. A more advanced grammar of Hausa for use in
secondary schools;

4. A revised edition of Hausa Spelling (the Hausa
edition) ;

“A

- More Hausa readers for primary schools;

6. A successor to Rankin’s Dabarun Talifi;

7. Ensuring the continued supply of the best of the
Literature Bureau’s and Gaskiya Corporation’s
older titles;

8. Translations of English (and other language)
classics into Hausa and other major languages;

9. Encouragement of new writers of poetry, plays

who acted as a police force, detecting and foiling plot
after plot against the king. Moreover, it is said that he
attempted to control the trade in arms and. ammunition
with a view to ensuring that only his trusted servants
and their relations would be in possession of fire arms.
The reaction of the Ife people to all these was wholly
hostile. They believed that Abeweila was building the

refugees into an army which he intended to use to |

subdue Ife. Civil disturbances became the order of the
day. By the time Abeweila died in 1851 or 1852, Ife
had polarised into two armed camps. The question was
not whether there would be war but when the war
would come.

The war came in 1852. Shortly after or before Abe-
weila’s death, the refugees, acting, it is said, on the
advice which Abeweila had given them, moved out in a
body and established a separate settlement, which
they called Modakeke, just outside the south-western
wall of Ile-Ife. The Ife, determined that Modakeke
should not stand and that its people should leave their
soil entirely, fell upon Modakeke. However, the
Modakeke repulsed them in a bloody battle but,
according to accounts later recorded by the Modakeke

in the 1880's, * refrained from following them into lle-Ife,

hoping, no doubt, that some settlement could yet be
effected with the Ife. But the Ife quickly recovered
from this defeat and again attacked Modakeke. This.
second battle went much like the first—and the
victorious Modakeke men entered Ile-Ife and sacked it,
taking many of its people into captivity and carrying
away much of its treasure.

Ife, then, reached the lowest depths of degradation in
1852. All the rest of its people who survived death and
captivity, fled from their burning town—most of them
going to settle in the village of Isoya, a small market
place on the road to Iebu-Igbo. There they were to be
for close on four years, while their town remained in
ruins and empty, its streets gradually giving in to wild
weeds,

At last, in 1855, the government of Ibadan, under the
leadership of the Balogun Ibikunle; intervened. Repre-
sentatives of the two parties came to Ibadan, their
disputes were settled and the Ife were told to go and re-
occupy their town. Many of them, especially those who
had been staying with relations and friends at Modakeke,
returned immediately to rebuild their houses. But the

majority found it difficult to trust the Modakeke and
therefore continued at Isoya. As late as 1858, many of
these were just coming to rebuild their houses. Conse-
quently, by this date, most of the town was still a heap
of ‘ruins, broken mud walls, old pots, etc.’ By August -
1858, they were just rebuilding the town walls, and
arrangements for the palace were just being considered
—the king, who had just returned to the town, being
housed near the palace ruins in a little ‘low shed about 20
feet long and 8 feet wide walled up with mud to the
height of 5 feet’. The Balogun and most of the other
chiefs were still at Isoya.® :

However, the town was ultimately rebuilt, more or
Jess in full. When the Rev. David Hinderer visited it
again in 1875,?° he found it in a considerably different
state from what it had been in 1858, and its king once
more the nmster of decent palace apartments and court-
yards. Buf“ the disaster of the Modakeke War left a
permanent mark—as payment for the Ibadan interven-
tion in 1855, both Ife and Modakeke were obliged to
become vassals of Ibadan, to pay annual tributes and
to contribute contingents to the Ibadan army whenever
the Ibadan chiefs demanded them. For close on thirty
years after this date, the ancient kingdom of Ife was to
constitute a part of the vast empire of Ibadan. An
Ibadan Ajele (resident official) was placed at Ile-Ife
(others were stationed at Modakeke, Apomu, Ikire,
Gbongan and Ipetumodu) to supervise the collection
of the tributes and ensure continued loyalty of the people
to their Ibadan overlords. On many occasions, the Ife
people had to take part, on the side of Ibadan, in wars
which did not concern them,*1

_ The Modakeke War was not the end of Ife’s disasters.
In fact, the greatest was yet to come. A mighty storm
had been steadily gathering in the whole of Yorubaland.
The events since the thirties had gradually led to the
emergence of Ibadan as the most powerful of all the
Yoruba states, Ibadan had evolved as a republic in which
military capability was the dominant consideration
in the selection of leaders. #* It was an open society which
welcomed all Yoruba men irrespective of their place of
origin and in which birth counted for very little and
personal abilities counted for everything. Naturally,
such a town became the promised land to capable and
ambitious men from all over Yorubaland, men in
search of honours and attainments which they could
never hope to aspire to in the traditionalist setting of

college. Every member of the family was quite proud
even, his skeptical brothers, James, John, and Peter came
to watch the ceremony. Congratulations poured in from
relatives and friends. But all along the new Rev.
Samuelson I had his mind on his mission to go to Africa
to serve Christ and his lost sheep.

For four months, Samie prepared for his voyage to
Africa. He bought several personal needs including two
bicycles and a new handy motor cycle, recently deve-
loped by the Canadian Motor Co. Mr Brown had tried
one in his station and the machine proved its worth.
Therefore, he recommended that young missionaires
coming out should be encouraged to bring them out to
Africa. Samie bought one.

The candidacy of Samie had an easy acceptance. He got
his papers of appointment as a missionary in. October as
the cold Canadian weather was setting in; but he knew
too well that within five months he would be bathing
in the hot burning sun of Africa.

He left for Africa in December and for three months,
the steamship sailed over the rough waves of the Atlantic,

stopping at various European and African ports. It wasa

trying time for the young minister-missionary. He

became sick being his first time at sea; and he remem-

bered his little city of Mainlain, the good old county of
Mainlain. He had to leave everything behind for an
unknown country. But his faith in Christ continued to
rise above his home-sickness. He fought fiercely against
the seeming selfish feelings within him.

By late March, the ship put to berth at Lagos habour.

It was the dry season in Nigeria and the cold harmattan
had come to Lagos with its dusty dry winds.

Meeting him at the port of Lagos were representatives
of the Christian Mission to Africa. He was driven to the
Mission House in the new township area of the city.
And for the next one month he lived in Lagos under-
going briefings, and a study of the Yoruba language
which would be his workmg tongue.

After mastering the greetings and some intricate
local customs, he was on his way to his station. He was
assigned to a mission post in Yagbaland.

In his company were several mission workers, some
carried his belongings while others were there to keep
him company. They journeyed for two wecks before
they got to Egbe his station.

Samie party was welcomed to the city by the Oba

47

who had had some talks with the mission at Abita and
Jebba. He requested that the Christian mission to Africa
should open a station in his country. For the mission,
that was a splendid opportunity to carry the message of
Christ to places he had not been properly known.
The people of Egbe assisted the new missionary in
setting up the station and within a period of three months
there was a church and a mission house, For the Egbe
people the white man’s religion was a novelty but his
ways were quite amusing and often stupid. They kept
their religion, but were also receptive to Samie if for no:
other reasons than for questions of keeping one’s
words, since they invited-him in the first place. For the,
young missionary and the Egbe people the moment of
truth was to come sooner than anyone expected anyway.
Assigned by the Oba to Samie as messenger, was a
local sage named Ajayi Ogun, the son of Chief Ogun-
mola, the spiritual Head of Egbe Hunters. Chief Ogun-
mola was respected throughout the land because of his
art. In those days a sage would combine many attributes.
Thus Chief Ogunmola was also a leading herbalist and
had made many sick people well through his art. Of his
four sons and. three daughters, only his last child look
after him. He lavished much love on Ajayi Ogun, and
early in life introduced him to the Oba as'a promising

youngman.

One of the natural gifts which Ajayi Ogun inherited
from his father was the “shrinking of roads.” This was
an art whereby a distance of ten miles could be shortened,
through supernatural means to five miles or could be .
lengthened to twenty miles by similar methods. As far as
Ajayi was concerned there was no contradiction between
his inheritance and the new order. He practised his art
continuously, and even when sent on errands by Samie,
he consulted his hidden powers.

It was the third year that the missionary entered Egbe
that he began to notice things. He became familiar with
the people and their varied customs, speaking the langu-
age and the dialects quite well. Ajayi who became a
leading figure in the church and a senior messenger
for the mission, was once involved in an argument with
the man of God as Samie was popularly known, Ajayi
was sent to Ilorin to collect the weekly mail but instead
of spending the usual two days to walk there and return,
he got back the same day!. He brought the letters back
with him and there was little doubt that he performed
the journey, but the missionary was puzzled. How could

5kxxoZMBZK9IE8y6RHg0,"However Mallam Zaki returned in 1810 with the
Katagum and Hadejia Fulani contingents and
Dunoma was forced to flee to Kurnawa. At the
same time the Bagirmi from the east, quite possibly
as a result of intrigue on the part of Mallam Zaki,
began to raid south and west of Lake Chad.
The Bornu fortunes were lower than ever before
and once again an appeal was made to al-Kanemi.
He came back with his Kanembu warriors and
also called up the Kwalmi Shuwas and Arabs of
the Walad Himet. As many as thirty clans came
in answer to his summons.

The Mai established his court at Kabela near the
shores of Lake Chad and al-Kanemi settled,
surrounded by his supporters from east of the
lake, at Ngurno. From here he directed a series of
Vigorous campaigns against the Fulani, causing
them to evacuate all the areas which they had
occupied, including Gazargamu which, however,

was never reoccupied and stands empty to this

day. All that can be seen of the capital now are the
high grass-covered mounds which were its walls
and in the centre some scattered bricks which are
all there to show where the Mai’s palace once
stood. Some miles away at Gamboru are the ruins
of the brick palace in which Mai Idris Alooma
had been brought up by his mother as a means of
keeping him aloof from the softness and intrigue
of the court within the city.

Al-Kanemi still looked upon himself as the
saviour of Bornu. He did not seek power but in the
beginning merely installed himself to give support
with his Kanemi forces to the expulsion of the
Fulani. But such a campaign needed money. It is
said that within a period of ten months al-Kanemi
fought as many as forty battles. So to finance the
expeditions he had the Mai make over to him half
of the revenues of the liberated provinces. In
gratitude for their freedom people were also coming
in and offering gifts to help with the campaigning.
An average of twenty horses a day were received in
this manner, as well as other gifts of arms and
volunteers coming in to join the victorious armies.

On the establishment of al-Kanemi’s head-
quarters at Ngurno and hearing of his successes
against the Fulani, the Bagirmi moved their
armies away. Meanwhile Mai Dunoma stayed in

his court at Kabela doing nothing. Naturally the
Kanuri aristocracy, who had lost heavily during
the Fulani occupation of areas which had been
in fiefdom to them, rallied more and more to
al-Kanemi as the man who was putting Bornu
back on a sound footing. Dunoma resented this
and showed his resentment. For the sake of unity
in Bornu al-Kanemi had him replaced in 1811
with Muhammadu Ngileruma, but after three
years he restored Dunoma to the throne.

In that same year, 1814, he moved away from
Ngurno and established a new town at Kuka.
It is said that he was travelling looking for a site
for a new capital and reading his Kur’an as he
rode. As he reached the last Sura he found himself
in a grove of kuka trees and ordered that the town
be built there. A palace was constructed for him
and the town was called Kuka, later becoming
Kukawa.

The founding of Kuka marks a new period in
al-Kanemi’s life. So far he had been merely acting »
in the role of a liberator for Bornu. But in the
course of this liberation he had built up for himself
a stronger following than that enjoyed by the Mai,
living in effete and idle luxury at Kabela. He must
have decided about this time that whether he
wanted it or not he was the ipso facto ruler of the
land. The building of the new town was to mark
his independence of the Mai, and although he
still conceded to him the rule, most of the admin-
istration of Bornu was carried out from Kuka
without any further reference to Kabela.

Such a situation did not suit Dunoma who was
becoming increasingly jealous of al-Kanemi.
Unable to rally support amongst his own notables
he turned to the Bagirmi Sultan Burgu Manda
and began intriguing with him to invade Bornu
and oust al-Kanemi. The Bagirmi only too
willingly seized this opportunity and came unex-
pectedly on Kuka, destroying the palace which had
been built for al-Kanemi. The Mai later went to
Ngala, the eastern gateway of Bornu, to meet the
Bagirmi Sultan. Unfortunately for him Burgu

For majority members of this troupe that went

go to strengthen African cultural unity. To Nigeria,
it was also another great opportunity to project

because he wanted the creature to kill him at once.
Still he was hearing the call so when he raised up his

Waterside waiting for him. She asked him why he
“ayed so long, she was afraid because they had no

friend. He said that she should not mind, since there
was life, there was hope, but she should help him
build the house.

They started to build the house with sticks and
palmfronds. The town’s people laughed at them saying:
“Look at these two poor beasts, poverty is the worst
disease, it causes many other ills, now they are mad.
Maybe they want to live at the waterside so that they
may die quicker. This angry river will soon snap them
off with its mighty waves..Nobody should talk to
them. Let them die and leave the town for us.” They
finished building the house in a few hours, and went to
their other small hut. He bought some few things for
food with the one pound.

When night came, he went down to the palmfrond
house at the waterside and lay on the bamboo altar-like
bed waiting for the result. When the church clock
struck 12, he came to peep outside because he heard the
water shake, and saw that the water was overflooding
the bank and then going down, the waterside was

coming out from the water, as tall as a palm tree.
When he stood on the land, he began to be shorter and
shorter until he became as short as a keg, with a big
basket on his head and entered the house.

As soon as he entered the house, the poor man could
not look at him, directly because his body was shining
like the sun. When the poor man was lying on his
bamboo bed with closed eyes, he heard something
pouring on the floor of the other room where the
water man was. After a short time, the poor man did
not hear any noise, so he opened his eyes and saw that
the house was as dark as it was. The water man took
three steps and stopped.The poor man was laid on the
bamboos until the church clock stirred up by striking 4.
When he awoke, he went out through the back door to
his wife and told her that they should come down to the
palmleaves house to see what might have happened.

They came down to the house with a little lamp
they had. When they entered the other room, they
found that there was a big heap of money on the
middle of the room. Besi, the poor man’s wife said:

X0xKoZMBZK9IE8y6Eng-,"THE POOR MAN AND
THE WATER MAN

By

R. A. FREEMAN

HERE was once a poor man, and his wife who
were both of Okrika near Port Harcourt. They
Were not counted among the town’s population
because of their poverty, but still they were as happy
as birds during summer in England. Nobody remembers
his name now and married his wife during his flour-
ishing days. When the wife’s parents saw that their son
in-law had become the poorest man in the town, they
Were worried and started to work against the marriage,
especially the mother.

One day the mother called the father to be seated.
She said: “Please, don’t be annoyed for my call.”
The husband said: “Why should I be annoyed, have I
ever been annoyed whenever you call me for a reason-
able talk If you have anything to say, say on, my
_ Wife.” She said: “We are not little children, at least
we have got four issues, we see with our eyes to know
whether something is bad or good.” The husband cut
mM and said: “Just tell what you want to tell me, don’t
Pteach, we are not in church. As you said, really I am
ot a small boy, so just say at once.” “Yes my husband,”
Said the wife. She continued: “Besi is our first issue and
she is the only daughter we have, my womb is closed,
‘can bring no more child, so we ought to take care of

ne offspring we have. Last week I went to Besi and
told her that she should leave that dead among the
living and marry somebody better. She said that she
Would not leave him. Only death could separate them,
he would Bet rich in future by God’s grace.”

The husband said: “Well, you are clearly understood,

‘ut you should not be in haste. Nobody likes suffering
on this earth, so you should take life as you see it. Besi
the sufferer has told you that you should not be worried,
$0 far as Tam concemed, just leave her with her husband.
That is what | can say about this matter.”

This sound advice did not satisfy her. One fine

Sunday morning when the church bell was ringing for
service, the mother of Besi was in full preparation to
visit her daughter for the second trial. She told the
husband that she was going to the church. The husband
was very happy to hear that she was going for service,
but this woman directed her way to the poor man’s
hut. When she reached the hut, the man was out for
begging. She told Besi to go and search for him. The

. daughter knew that her mother was going to molest

him. In spite of that, she went and called him home. He
was thinking that his mother in-law was calling him for

better purpose. The woman said: “Man! I have seen

123

enough of your poverty. Besi is not your sister nor
your daughter, you married her last year. I want to take
my daughter to give her to another man who will take
proper care of her and will help me too. It is very hard
to get a child. Why can’t you die and leave the world,
you dead among the living.” |
Besi said: “My mother, yes, you are quite right but —
you must think deeply before you address somebody
in this way whether poor or not. Could you remember

what you said when I told you that this man was

asking me for marriage: You said that you should
advise me to marry him because he was a mannered
somebody. You did not say that I should marry him
because he was rich You want me to divorce this
man and marry another. That means, if that man
becomes poor, I will divorce him again because God
created me to marry only rich men. My mother, I
think your plan will come to a failure, I can’t switch
from tree to tree like a monkey. Well, here is my
husband whose nickname is ‘the dead among the
living,’ maybe he has something to say.”

The poor man said: “My in-law, this speech I am
going to make is just a lamentation of my life, so
don’t be annoyed.

_ who lived with him, and Tiger his brown dog, he joined
Salau. They took the car down to the garage for a final

check-up before their journey the following day.

The garage boys admired the new Red Bird Model,
and gave it the necessary “go-over”. Except for the
change of oil and the fillmg of the petrol tank, the
Operation was a routine matter: and they were soon on
their way back to the house where they lived.

To top the list, however, he included Tiger. They
Packed enough foods, drinks and other necessities in the

to bid them good-bye they were all set to take off.

__ Since there were only few roads between Idofin and

Mando, their choice was a newly built road, though

t meant an, extra 80 miles of journey because of some

During the harmattan it is often desirable to travel
during the night to beat the traffic and the harsh weather.
: Was exactly what they attempted to do. For it was
“Snsidered cooler and more congenial to travellers.

They left Mando at about 3:00 a.m. They tried to
ra mutch distance as possible before dawn. At about
*X o'clock, the city of Kontagora was before them.
Salau drove all the way. In Kontagora he suggested that

“ete should be a re-check of the engine oil, water in the
Tadiator and the petrol tank. He performed the opera-
""ons Within a few minutes and announced that every-
thing Was in good order, and that they would not need

“"" Was too’ early to eat. They were in Kontagora for

“TY minutes without satisfying their bodies and pro-

bably their minds. But Tiger had some food. He was
already restless just a mile before they drove into
Kontagora. To save their nerves they gave him enough
food to eat; and sure that did the trick. He went to sleep.

The city was still asleep but there were some people
out in the streets apart from the sturdy Esso Station
Manager and his crew of attendants. A group of farmers
with their hoes on their shoulders were leaving the city
for their farms on the outskirts of the city. There was
also a minstrel who produced some interesting notes on
his goje! He wanted to entertain Dele and his friends but
they were not particularly keen. Sanmi thought it was
too early in the day to listen to music. “Music is for
relaxation and one hardly relaxes when he is on a long
journey”, he told the minstrel. The “goje” player was
not impressed by what he said but he soon discovered
that they were too concerned about their car and the
journey. He left after singing an inaudible piece which
the gas station manager interpreted as a sign of utter dis-
gust with those at the station. That the minstrel felt they
were not gentlemen of means and station in life.

They left Kontagora Salau was still behind the wheels.
Between this city and Jebba there was only one small
town, Mokwa, 30 miles north of Jebba, otherwise the
distance was without settled communities. Unlike other
areas of the country with large cities, private cars became
rare, and huge vans that carried merchandise fiom, the
coast to the interior were everywhere. For the first time
Dele realised that he had left the civilized world, though
they were still in the saloon car, and riding on a paved
road.

Salau soon burst into a song peculiar to his trade.
But for Sanmi he was fast asleep in. the back seat; Jide
was re-arranging some of the fruits he purchased at
Kontagora without anyone’s permission and knowledge.

With Tiger sleeping in Dele’s lap and engine humming
like a busy bee they drifted swiftly on at a speed of 80
miles-per-hour on the straight Kontagora-Jebba Road.
They had travelled for about two hours and as they saw
the roofs of Mokwa the engine stalled and the vehicle
refused to move. Being unfamiliar with engines Dele
thought the motor had been ruined, but Salau felt it was
the battery that was not functioning properly!

Parking along-side the road at the junction of Konta-
gora-Bida-Jebba Road, they began an earnest examina~

Railway Station to collect some money from Abdul
Salami Ade, the local Chief of Mechanics, who had
loaned to Salau tools on the condition that a deposit of
£6 was made. :

Ade was neither in his office at the Railway Station
nor at his residence, but one of his disgruntled appren-
tices, Bob Jebba tipped them off. His master was hiding
away in a friend’s house so as not to refund the sum of
money left with him.

We drove straight to the house of Alhaji Yaya Dan
Torin to ask for their money. Ade was astonished to see
them and his friend who had been told of his pranks on
them, was also stunned.
~ Dele got out of the car together with Salau, and after
the customary grectings they introduced the matter.
Ade was sorry that they missed him at his place of work
and also at his home, but he denied running away from
them.

Speaking first, Dele told them that they were there

only to prove a point that although money was impor-
tant in itself it should never take over from the normal
feeling for those in distress. That it should be the concern
of all to remove that type of attitude. There was a
grudging agreement from Ade and Alhaji Yaya Dan
Ilorin. They waited for the refund, but they had spent
the money in buying two bottles of lager beer, and
another bottle of stout beer. They were celebrating their
success. At that point Dele said that it was not only
machines that were full of tricks, that onc should never
trust a stranger too.

They left in complete disappointment and there was
no stop inti they got to Morin where they wanted to
sce some friends.

~At about 1 O'Clock a.m, brakes were applied infront

of de Branco compound. Dele was met by an anxious
fiancee and the entire family who had been holding a

POPULAR ETYMOLOGY IN

FFICIALLY and in fact, the drum signal

we hear on the Nigerian Broadcasting
Service was designed to reproduce the intonation
pattern of the English statement: “This is the
Nigerian Broadcasting Service”. But Yoruba
folk derive much fun from trying to decipher
the intended message of the signal.

Some people say that the signal means Ni nu
ikdkd didi l’a tin se ’bé, “It’s inside a black pot
that we cook stew”. Some say it is B’Ohibadan
ba ki, ta ni 6 j?oyé? “When the Olubadan
dies, who will become chief?” Still others decode
it as Ldt Ibadan ni ’bi I’a tin fo “hin, “It’s from
here in Ibadan that we are speaking”. Such

popular interpretations stem from the mistaken
belief that the “talking drum” was “speaking”
the Yoruba language. All of them are very in- |
teresting guesses, but none of them is correct, |
in spite of the chance similarity between the
intonation pattern of the English sentence and —
the tone pattern of the Yoruba statements popu-—
larly offered as an explanation of the signal.
That is popular etymology.

for his backward glances, for the occasional pickings of
crumbs off the abandoned poet’s table, for the vainglory
the thought of importance might have given rise to.
All of these sounded so grand and genuine till Hopkins
struck the denouement. Despite these vital and fright-
ening considerations and decisions, Hopkins would
still ‘compose as occasion shall fairly allow.” And
occasion did quite often allow because a poet does not
sit down being a poet all day. He could be a medical
doctor, an administrator, a dramatist, a lawyer or evena
Jesuit priest. And people of course only wrote poetry
‘when occasion allowed. This is where Chester Burns
misrepresented Hopkins and Dr Gardner underrated
him, For Hopkins was intrinsically a rebel. The dis-
quietude of dissent and the restlessness of rebellion were
the makings of his fibre. Though he feared he might
undergo“ asevere judgment from God, , .” yethe would
compose. It is difficult here to draw a distinct line
between ambition and rebellion. As, when Macbeth
contemplated Duncan’s murder, he realized that all
would be well if “this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time;—
We'd jump the life to come. But in these cases
We still have judgment here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which being taught, return
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice

seesee--k have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o’er leaps itself
and falls on the other.” *

The analysis here of the after effects of a contemp-
lated. crime is clear and complete. And beyond the
maze of complex considerations on morality and
eternal laws of justice and retribution, there was the
dazzling glitter of some achievement prodding the
protagonist to rebel, to strike out against his considered

views, to rebel against society, against God. Hopkins
had the same dilemma, But he happened to be a greater
mind than Macbeth. Hopkins was positively rebellious,
self-Re-creating in his self-denial. He was the Outsider,
inside what most tortured him, what he most desired

and adored, his saviour, his Christ, his poetry. He thus
became the single man who has tried and even succeeded
to kill two birds with a stone-throw. When Chester
Burns suggested that Hopkins preferred being a saint
to being a poet, he seemed to loose sight of Hopkins
device to fly to heaven of the wings of poetry; a task
which he deftly accomplished. Each of his compositions
was a song of His-self, a cannonization and perfection
of a life of struggle and double standards. And so,
whether he wanted to become more of a saint or more
of a poet, he was none without being the other and if it
would take the Jesuit order another century to proclaim
Hopkins #*saint, he has already taken his seat beside
other saints of poetry, through time.

Iam all at once what Christ is, since He was what

The indestructibility of the spirit reinforces the in-
vincibility of the spirit-world where whatever gem —
that enters lives forever.

Hopkins was not just a poet, he was a very’ great"" poet
and critic. He started off a revolution and reform in
poetry which have even influenced the present century. —
“Inscape is the main of poetry” he maintained, arguing —
that everything expresses in its connatural activity, its —
own individuality: 7

Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:
deals out that thing indoors each one dwells; —
selves — goes itself. |

Writing to Patmore in their discussion of Barnes he
said:

“T scarcely understand you about*reflected light:
every true poet, I thought, must be original and
originality a condition of poetic genius; so that each
poet is like a species in nature (not an individuun
genericum or specificum) and can never recur.”

To Hopkins, imagery, melody and such details are nO
use unless they are woven into the canvas of the poets _

lkxboZMBZK9IE8y6HXir,"developed greatly since its ignominious defeat
by the untrained Muslims~at Tabkin. Kwotto.
Alkalawa had already resisted the first dry season
campaign of the Muslims and its fortifications
had been kept in a first-class state of repair.

Gobir was one of the seven Hausa states whose
ruling classes claimed descent from Bayajida, the
mythical warrior from Baghdad who slew the
serpent which lived in the well at Daura and
married the queen. He already had left his poste-
rity at Biram ta Gabbas by a Bornu princess and
the remaining six states developed from his
grandchildren deriving from the queen of Daura.
Such is the legend at any rate. Bayajida seems to
have his origin in the Ibadite sectary Abu Yazid
who for years rebelled against the Fatimite

rulers of Tunis before finally being killed in 947 ~
after which his rebel bands scattered into the -

Sahara, forming one of the numerous groups of
Berber migrants into the western Sudan at this
time.

The legend may therefore be taken to indicate
the arrival of groups of Berber migrants who
intermarried with local inhabitants and gradually
formed ruling aristocracies which over the years
crystallized into the seven Hausa states. These
states, perhaps because of the common ethnic
origin of their rulers, or perhaps because they were
naturally interdependent in the fertile Hausa
uplands where they lay, formed a loose confedera-
tion over the centuries, each state with its own
function. Thus, whilst Kano was the trading and
manufacturing state, Daura supplied the grain,
Zaria the slaves and so on.

Gobir’s role was that of guardian against the
raiding desert tribes. One of the characteristics of
the Hausa states was that they were all city states
after the manner of the old Phoenician or Greek
settlements on the Mediterranean seaboard: the
walled city of Kano had existed since the eleventh
century. But Gobir, because of its role, had re-
mained unsettled and mobile, changing its capital
every few years.

The choice of the site of Alkalawa in 1757

86

seems to have been dictated by tactical considera-
tions. The city was within easy marching distance
of both Zamfara and the limits of the Tuareg
controlled areas and thus could safeguard the
states from attack from the north-west and east.
The fertile river valley provided grain and grazing’
for livestock and large areas of farmland were
incorporated, as was the custom with all the
Hausa cities, within the city walls, so as to provide
fodder for the inhabitants ‘during a long siege.
The Hausa city was a self-contained, compact
unit, and Gobir, with the construction of Alkalawa,

_ had finally become a fortified city state, conform-

ing to the other six states.

_ At the time of the wars with the Shehu the
fortifications of Alkalawa were at their best and
strongest. The walls, probably about thirty feet
high, were made of hardened clay, the outer
surface being coated with a smooth, unbroken
lining which offered no foothold to attackers.
The few gates were fortified and guarded by
enfilading strong points. In those days city walls
were not the wide easily ‘accessible apertures
which we know today in Kano and Zaria, but
deep narrow slots just wide enough to admit a
loaded camel.

High up inside the walls were lined with
terraces from which, protected by battlements
and turrets, the defenders could pour showers of
arrows and stones onto the attackers below. To
add further protection the walls were surrounded
on the outside by a wide, dry moat filled with
dense thorn which prevented the passage of both
horsemen and foot warriors.

These were the types of defence which had, over
the centuries, stood the test of time in Hausaland.
It is true that the walled cities had not been
completely invincible: they had not been able to
resist the Songhai or Kwararafa invasions for
example; but Yunfa cannot be blamed for con-
sidering that the forces of the Shehu did not offer
the same kind of threat.

All these considerations and others must have
gone through the minds of the Shehu’s generals
as they contemplated their forthcoming actions

It was said that he intended to perform the Mecca
pilgrimage but in the event he went to Kano and
stayed there teaching until the end of the Ramadan
fast.

The forces before Alkalawa rested throughout
the fasting and then in the spring renewed their
attacks on the city, helped by Namoda and Umaru
Dallaji. These spring attacks were not seriously
intended to take the city but were more in the
nature of harassment to play on the nerves of the
Gobirawa.

At the same time Muhammad Bello, the Shehu’s
son, had taken a column down past Kebbi to
Dendi and chased the Dendi army across the
Niger river.

Later on in the spring campaign, having with-

drawn some way from Alkalawa, Namoda and _

Umaru Dallaji encountered a column of Gobirawa

and defeated them. During the remainder of the ~

year the Shehu rounded up the residue of the
Kebbi aristocracy who had been supporting
Yunfa since the fall of Birnin Kebbi and they
acknowledged his suzerainty. Argungu was also
captured and with this the Fulani positions in the
Zamfara valley were completely safe on the west
and the south. Yunfa had lost all his allies and now
stood alone in Alkalawa. .

The Fulani felt the time had now come for a
final assault on the Gobir capital, and at the
commencement of the rains word was sent out by
the Shehu summoning his forces for a third
campaign against Alkalawa. Many of his supporters
had already gone to their homes for the farming
season. Immediately after the harvest the columns
began assembling in answer to the Shehu’s
summons. The forces from Gwandu and other
neighbouring localities under Aliyu Jedo assem-
bled at Gwandu where the Shehu was now living.
He placed them under Bello, now twenty-nine
years old. They set off from Gwandu and marched
eastwards until they met Namoda and Umaru
Dallaji with the Zamfara and Katsina contingents.
It is not possible even from the many contem-
porary records of events to have any accurate idea
of the strength of this combined army, but it is

90

hardly likely to have been less than thirty thousand
strong and could have been as great as fifty
thousand. é

Under the overall command of Bello they
marched rapidly towards Alkalawa. On approach-
ing the city the mighty army split up into its
component parts again. Namoda advanced from»
the east whilst Umaru Dallaji, who had an excep-
tionally large contingent, attacked from the south
and west. Aliyu Jedo commenced his attack from
the west, near Dallaji’s columns, but at the last
moment wheeled northwards and delivered a
surprise attack from there.

The attack was wholly successful. Within a very
short time the walls had been stormed and the city
entered. The Gobirawa fought back valiantly but
were unable to resist this overwhelming assault
from every direction. The Fulani swarmed through
the city and surrounded the palace of Yunfa. In
the fierce fighting he was killed. The date was
Monday, 3rd October, 1808. Thenews of the victory
was brought to the Shehu in Gwandu at midday
on the following Saturday. Legend asserts that he
was told of the battle by jinns on the day it was
fought. There is also a legend extant among the
Gobirawa that a host of jinns was seen over
Alkalawa during the battle carrying away the
spirit of Yunfa.

After the battle Yunfa’s wife Katembale was
captured as well as his mother Maitakalmi and a
servant Iyargurma. Katembale was later married
by Bello and she bore him two sons. The town was -
not wholly destroyed in the fighting and many of
the citizens continued to live there, becoming
Muslims. Those who did not wish to convert
moved north and westwards to other Gobir
settlements. The city of -Alkalawa was placed
under direct rule by the Shehu and he appointed
one Modibo Muhammadu Ali Fodio as his
administrator.

This was the end of the Gobirawa as a strong
opposition to the Fulani. For nine years they kept
the peace and then certain disruptive elements
commenced raiding again. After the fall of Alka-
lawa the Shehu had appointed Bello in charge of
the eastern marches of that part of the empire

okxeoZMBZK9IE8y6m3jH,"LUKERE: FOUNDER OF ISHTWO

By

*WaLE Dawopu

SHIWO a Yoruba town renowned for cultural

traditions is about seventy-four miles to Lagos,
nine miles to the Administrative Headquarters of
Ijebu Province, Ijebu-Ode and lies between Ijebu-
Ode and Epe.

Geographically, the town lies in an open rain
belt within the equatorial jungle and is almost
buried by thick forest. Ishiwo is hemmed in by
‘stormy and hilly landmarks inundated by half-
grass, half-forest land, watered by numerous
meandering streams and rivulets which are respon-
sible for the surrounding greenery and beautiful
* scenery.

The town is moderately large and next to the
headquarters in area. It is about 44 square miles
and has about eleven small villages whose inhabit-
ants are mainly Yoruba. There are also Hausas,
Ibos .and Mid-Westerners.

The history of Ishiwo is not recorded and
legends and oral traditions reveal no actual date
of its founding. Legends foretell how the town
derived its name and how the rulers became
known as Petu of Ishiwo. It was a long existing
history dating back to over three hundred years.

According to legends, Lukere was the first
deity to settle at the present site of Ishiwo. Like
other deities worshipped by our ancient men,
Lukere the god of the then people of Ishiwo was
the father of Ifa oracle who led the people all the
way from Ado. Lukere had supernatural powers
and quite very spiritual and could foretell unfore-
seeable occurrences and eventualities.

This ‘deity’ couldturn living thingsto non-living,
fought for his people always and could incapacitate
during war. Hence Ishiwo people were always
victorious over their enemies in wars and when-
ever in trouble they pray to him till this day.

How Lukere became a spiritual, invisible deity
and immortal is still a wonder. It was proclaimed
that he was the Babalawo of Petu the Asinbasorisa

98

from Ado. The god and his master Petu as well
as their people left their original home during the
period of hardship, war, famine and great] amenta-
tion with all moveable materials and livestock.
They travelled for days and months on foot before
they got to Ado a place not very far from Epe.
It was usual of Petu to kill one of his slaves for
sacrifiee during every important festival he per-
forméd to appease the wrath of gods of his fathers.
This practice nearly immolated all his slaves.
Many of his people died on the way owing to the
strain of long trekking and disease.

The people of Epe were afraid of this great chief
and after serious quarrels with Petu for defeating
them, they resolved and came to terms. Petu,
Lukere and his people remained in a very small
enclosure hence they wanted to proceed. Lukere
sought the advice of his oracle and declared to
Petu that they should leave Ado for another place.

_Lukere spread a mat on the Lagoon, sat with
his master and some attendants and sailed (on
the mat) arriving at Ejinrin a market town some
miles south-west of Ijebu-Ode. Lukere’s spiritual
Inspiration urged them to disembark from their
wonderful boat and go on land. They were well
received, and integrated themselves with the other
settlers they found at Ejinrin. Lukere went back
to bring along other followers from Ado. They
were here for many years, but found this place
too small for their needs. They ruled the people of

feared by all its Ijebu and Oyo chiefs and their followers.
Moreover, the Ife authorities at home, glorying in their
new greatness, and seeing what strength was to be
gained from winning the Oyo refugees to their
kingdom, began to attract these refugees on a large
scale. In fact, the evidence strongly suggests that the
Ife leaders went as far as to exploit the ancient traditions
which represent Ife as the ancestral home of all Yoruba
peoples, in order to persuade many of the refugees to
“come back home’’ now that things were bad abroad.
In due course, many of the citizens of Owu and the
vanquished Egba towns began also to migrate to Ife.
The population of many Ife villages—like Ipetumodu,
Edunabon, _Yakoyo, Moro—swelled overnight. At
first, the mew-comers settled in these villages, but a
direct threat to the villages by detachments of the
Fulani forces from the direction of Ede, compelled
them to move into the city of Ile-Ife itself. The Ife
chiefs vied with one another in inviting these refugees
to come and settle in their quarters; they also gave them
land on which to farm. As the refugees paid for the latter

kindness by working for the chiefs on’ the farms, their —

coming proved highly profitable to the chiefs. More-

over, many of them were willing to work for wages -

as farm labourers; and many Ife people seized this
opportunity to raise large farms.?

The salutory effects of the influx of the refugees were,
however, not only economic but also political. Ife
expanded its fighting forces by attracting many of the
new men to take up arms, and then began to encroach
on the territories of its neighbours—especially the Ondo
in the south. Finally, about 1845, the Ife forces, taking
advantage of a serious conflict in the Ondo kingdom
between Ode-Ondo and Oke-Igbo, marched south,
occupied Oke-Igbo and forced the people of Ode-Ondo
to scatter into the deep forests of the southern districts
of their kingdom. Though Ondo resistance did not
entirely cease, the Ife were able to convert Oke-Jgbo
into an Ife town—thus expanding the frontiers of their
kingdom many miles southwards.*

As the mid-century approached, however, the history
of Ife took a different turn, and not only were the pro-
mises of the first half-century not fulfilled, but by 1850
Ife was to sink to thevery bottom of defeat and
destruction. |

For this turn of events, the stage had been gradually

35

MO

setting itself for some time. The first significant occur-
rence was the loss, probably in 1830, by Chief Okunade,
the Maye, of his leadership of Ibadan. Okunade was a
great warrior, but an arrogant and temperamental man.
Not long after the foundation of Ibadan, his rashness led
him into a conflict with the Oyo leaders in Ibadan—a

conflict which ended in his expulsion from Ibadan and

his unsuccessful attempt, at the head of a large coalition
of forces comprising contingents from the Egba, the
Owu and leading Ife towns like Ikire, Apomu, Gbon-
gan and Ipetumodu, to reconquer the town. In this war,
called the Gbanamu War,’ the people of Ibadan showed
for the first time those fighting qualities which were to
make their town the terror of all Yorubaland in the
nineteenth century. The great Maye himself was killed
and many of the other leading Ife citizens of Ibadan had
to quit. The Ibadan followed up this victory by sacking
Apomu and attacking Ipetumodu not far from the walls
of Ile-Ife itself.

All these naturally came to have important effects on
the internal stability of the Ife kingdom. The Oyo
refugees who, as we have seen, had been excitedly
welcomed into Ife, now gradually lost their popularity
with the Ife people. Since they were kinsmen of the
people who had expelled the Ife from Ibadan and had
then gone on to invade the Ife kingdom, the refugees
became suspect as a sort of fifth column within Ife’s
walls. The alienation grew slowly, and as late as the
forties large numbers of the refugees were still in the
Ife army. But especially on the farms, the refugees were
being progressively subjected to discriminatory treat«
ment. Many of them were stripped of the right they had
earlier been given to farm on Ife territory, and in some
cases their hosts began to treat them like slaves. As time
went on, the refugees came to be the frequent victims
in the many public and private ceremonies and rituals
demanding human sacrifices at Ile-Ife.6

— In the reign of the Ooni Adegunle Abeweila i in the
second half of the forties, the tension quickly came to a
head.’ Abeweila’s mother was one of the refugees and,
naturally, when he became ruler of Ife, he tried to
improve the condition of the Oyo and other refugee
citizens of Ife and to reconcile them to their hosts.
Unfortunately, however, his measures were received
with hostility by the Ife. Stories began to circulate of
plans to assassinate him, and in the end the only people
he could trust were the refugees. From their ranks, he

greatness. It was they who, in 1840, destroyed the Fulani
army at the battle of Oshogbo and thereby put an end
to the Fulani drive southwards. Following this victory,
Ibadan had gone on, to establish its control over the
Oshun and then the Igbomina, Ijesha, Ekiti and Akoko
areas of Yorubaland.

Until 1860, Ibadan’s chief rival was Tjaye, another
refugee settlement led by the famous warrior, Kurunmi.
But both the Egba and Jjebu, who controlled all the
trade routes between Ibadan and the coast where arms
and ammunition could only be procured, were fright-
ened by Ibadan’s advance towards a hegemony over
Yorubaland and, therefore, often leagued against
Ibadan—their main weapon being the closure of the
trade routes; In 1860, the Ibadan-Ijaye rivalry led to war,
a war in which the Egba and Ijebu fought on the side
of jaye. aye was destroyed in 1862, but the Egba
and Tjebu obstructions to trade persisted."" At last, in
1877, the Ibadan decided to force a route to the coast
through the Egba territory. At once, the Egba and
Ijebu formed a military alliance. About a year later,

the Ijesha, Ekiti, Igbomina and Akoko, who had all °

along resented the excesses of the Ibadan Ajeles, seized

the advantage of [badan’s preoccupation with the war .

against the Egba and Ijebu, revolted, killed the Ibadan
Ajeles, formed themselves into a grand alliance called
the Ekitiparapo and declared war on Ibadan. Morin,
under the Fulani, immediately went into an alliance
with the Ekitiparapo.™* The storm had burst.

From the beginning of this country-wide war, the
Ife were obliged to fight for Ibadan, though clearly
against their will. Ife contingents took part in the Iba-
dan invasions of Egba territory in mid-1877 and in the
campaigns against the Ekitiparapo in. November 1878.
When, from 1879 on, the Ibadan and Ekitiparapa
finally encamped against. each other in a prolonged
engagement in the hilly country between, Igbajo and
Imesi-Ile, the Ife army was to be found in the Ibadan
camp,

All the time, however, practically all Ife people were
opposed to their participation in the Ibadan war effort.
For one thing, they strongly resented their subordination
to Ibadan. For another, they felt an identity of interest
with the people who had dared to throw off the Ibadan
yoke and were threatening the destruction of Ibadan.
At first, their opposition was expressed in plots, mostly

Me

by the young men at home, to prevent freedom of
passage to Ibadan traders who used the new route
through Ife, Ondo, lkale and Ilaje territories to Lagos, .
to procure arms and ammunition for the Ibadan forces.
Not infrequently, armed bands of Ife youths blocked the
route and kidnapped Ibadan traders. On such occasions,
the Modakeke came to the aid of the Ibadan traders and
gave them protection against the Ife.

The climax was reached in 1881-2."" In 1881, the
ibadan decided, as a diversionary manoeuvre, to send a
detachment through Ile-Ife to attack the ljesha country
in the rear at Oshu, a small village between Ile-Ife and
Ilesha. But the Ife did not only leak the plan to the
Ekitiparapo leaders, they also positively refused to let
their country be used in this way against their neigh-
bours. By 1882, it had become clear to the Ibadan
leaders that only force could remove the Ife obstruction.
Thereupon, a small detachment was sent from Igbajo
to Ile-Lfe to frighten the Ife people and arrest their ring-
leaders. In the event, an important Ife chief was killed
and the Ife immediately rose in revolt. Reinforcements
were sent post-haste from. the Ibadan camp at Igbajo
and the Modakcke were invited to join the Ibadan in
suppressing the Ife rebels. In the fighting that ensued,
Tle-Ife was once again sacked and its people forced to
flee, again mostly to Isoya. The Ife chiefs in the Ibadan
camp at Igbajo led their men across the battle-field
and went over to the Ekitiparapo. In response to their —
request, the Ekitiparapo sent strong detachments under
Chief Fabunmi, the second-in-command of the
Ekitiparapo forces, to join the Ife to destory Modakeke.
The Ibadan had to send troops to the defence of
Modakeke. Soon, a small Ijebu army under the Seriki
Ogunsigun crossed the Ife-Ijebu border to join the Ife
and Ekitiparapo forces.

Like the other wars going on in the country, the Ife
war against Modakeke developed into a ding-dong
affair. In 1886, as a result of the intervention of the
British administration of the Lagos colony, a “Treaty
of Peace and Friendship’ was entered into by the Ekiti-
parapo, Ibadan, Ijebu, Ife, Modakeke and others involved
in the wars.” The Ibadan and Ekitiparapo camps
between Igbajo and Imesi-Ile were burnt up as the two
beligerents withdrew. However, Ilorin refused to sign
the treaty and continued the war against Ibadan—
thus obliging the Ibadan and, therefore, the Ekitiparapo
to continue to maintain their forces intact.

GROWTH AND
PLANNING PROBLEMS

By

Dr P. O. SADA

HE average population growth rate in Lagos
Municipality between 1952 and 1963 was 8.6 per
cent, while that of the suburban areas was 19 per cent.
The city of Lagos with its fringe region is thus one of the
fastest growing cities in Africa. Like in many cities in
other developing countries, the population “implosion”
in the fringe region is accompanied by gross land-use
inefficiency. The major features of land-use are high
occupancy ratio, large family size, low quality houses,
warrow, untarred and largely unmotorable roads,
paucity of social facilities and shabby street layout.
In this article the objective is to indentify and analyse
the major factors involved in the evolution of this urban
landscape as well as the problems posed to land-use
planning.

EVOLUTION OF THE SUBURBAN
SETTLEMENTS

The suburban area consisted of isolated hamlets and
villages, all of which were absorbed in the wake of
metropolitan expansion. Three major settlement nuclea-
tions with slightly different evolutionary processes are

indentifiable. ‘They are Mushin—Itire complex, Igbobi-
Shomolu-Bagiga, and Ajeromi-Awori.

Mushin—Itire Complex

Mushin—Itire complex is the oldest of the suburban
settlements, dating back to about 1850. The carly settlers
were from the immediate north and northwestern
hinterlands, Ota—Igbessa and Ado-Odo.* They were
a farming group and settled in Ijesha-Tedo in Itire.
Notable among the early migrant families were Odofin,
Omiitashe, Ireakari and Onitire.

The opening of the railway link between Abeokuta
and Lagos marked the beginning of effective occupation
of Mushin, Many Egba (Abeokuta) traders took advan-
tange of the new railway route to step up their trade
with Lagos and later, many of them moved down and
settled in Mushin where they served as middlemen
traders. Mushin market was founded about this time
and the resident merchants bought in bulk from itin-
erant Egba traders and sold in nearby Lagos markets.
This early settlement point with Mushin market as the
commercial centre became the core of Mushin settle-
ment which up till today is predominantly inhabited
by the Egbas.

The second major factor in the settlement of Mushin
was the construction of the Lagos—Abeokuta road
which was opened in 1927. It further facilitated the
movement of people and goods between Lagos and

x0xooZMBZK9IE8y6Engs,"Abeokuta Province. The new road also greatly attracted
private developers and speculators who quickly bought
up and developed the land along the road, thus linking
up Mushin with Lagos Municipality in a continuously
built-up settlement now known as Idi-Oro. :

Between 1952 and 1963, the population in Mushin—
Itire complex increased by an annual average of 21.3 per
cent. This was due to the overflow of population from
the main city, a process which was favoured by (1) the
development of Ikeja Industrial Estate which is within
easy reach; (2) the extension of bus services to Lawan-
son—Itire which facilitates the movement of workers to
Apapa and Jjora Industrial Estates; (3) the introduction
of the mini-bus (Kiakia) service which helps in fast
transportation of workers from the remote parts of
the suburbs to the city bus-stops.

Igbobi-Shomolu-Bariga Settlement Complex

This suburban settlement complex is relatively new;
over 90 per cent of the buildings Were put up after
1952.) Prior to 1851, several points in this area served
as slave assembly centres for Lagos chiefs, notable

among whom were Basua, Olotu Odibo, Suweni, ’

Asogbon, Oloto, Olusemo, Bajulaiye and Obanikoro.5

A large proportion of the slaves came from Febu.

Province and were ferried across the Lagos lagoon to
Oworonsoki which then seryed as a small lagoon port.

The second wave of migrant settlers were soldiers
who were led into Lagos by Shomolu, a nephew of
Akitoye. Shomolu came from Abcokuta to help
Akintoye regain the throne of Lagos from Kosoko.

At the end of the civil war and following the annexation °

of Lagos in 1861, Shomolu retired to the present site
named after him.¢ .

The invasion of this neighbourhood by the municipal
authorities started with the building of the Orthopaedic
hospital in. 1945 for the treatment of world war I
victims. Soon after, Igbobi College was built and these
two establishments were quickly followed by low cost
houses. The outlying villages were further expanded
through the inflow of Ijebu migrants coming in by
Water route.

ae

The turning point in the development of this settle-
ment complex came with the opening of the Lagos-
[korodu Road in 1951. The new road reduced the land
distance between Ijebu Province and Lagos by 60 miles
and the time—distance by the water route by more
than 60 minutes, in addition to being safer. The

building of the road also ineant the opening of vast

areas around Onigbongbo group of villages for housing
development. Land speculation became rife. The
Kjebus who now had freer access to Lagos and who are
famous for their business acumen were the first arrivals
and at the forefront of the scramble for land. Further-
more, the expansion of employment opportunities
especially at Ikeja which is within three miles of Somolu
provided much attraction to migrants, Between 1952
and 1963, the population of Shomolu increased by
an annual average of 42.8 per cent. Over 60 per cent
of the people were from Ijebu Province.

Ajeromi-Awori Settlement Complex

Alayabiagba and Onibaba villages (now Ago Hausa)
were the mother settlements in this area, Alayabiagba
which was founded by Fakunle consisted of a few huts
and was located on the present site of the National Press.
The Onibaba village was founded by Governor Glover
in 1870 as a camp for smallpox » patients. The first
occupant was a Sopono(smallpox) priestess who claimed
she could cure the disease. Her grandson, Amusa Ayinla,
is now Bale (chief) of this area and claims ownership of
the entire land in the sub-district.

Government interest in this area became visible only
in 1929 when it acquired some land at Apapa Elemu for
private land development. The first few buildings put
up were very poorly constructed. The streets were
not planned and the land-use appeared chaotic. Con-
sequently, the Lagos City Council in r94o introduced
strict building regulations. These included the drawing
of house plans that must be approved before the com~
mencement of the buildings. Many of the’people were
unwilling to accept the regulations and so they moved
across the town boundary apparently to be out of reach
of the townauthorities and regulations—into the present
Bale Street in Ajegunle. It then cost only ss (five
shillings), a keg of palm-wine and a few bottles of oil to
acquire a plot of land from the Ojora family who owned
mnost of the land. This was the beginning of the shanty
settlement that developed in Ajegunle—Ajeromi. Most

y0xpoZMBZK9IE8y6V3jy,"CONCLUSION

One fact that has become evident from this study is
that there is an economic and political aspect to the
evolution and the problems of planning of the rural-
urban fringe. Economically, the development, of the
fringe follows the lag in the supply of low cost houses
behind demand; and politically, the local government
organization in the fringe has not kept abreast of the
social and economic organization and needs of the
expanding urban population. There is an urgent need
for government action both in physical planning and in
the reorganization of the governmental system. The
immediate measures will include:

(1) changing of the rural council to urban council
system}
the transfer of the operation of the public utilities
~—water supply, health and sanitation, and
transport—to some metropolitan area-wide
organization which shall be invested with a
quasi-corporation status and be responsible
directly to the Lagos State Government;
the setting up of a metropolitan planning board
which shall be empowered to supervise zoning
and all land-use developments at the fringe areas.

No useful purpose will be served if all the above
measures are adopted without simultaneously providing
some protection for poor resident tenants. The provision

of urban amenities will result, among other things, inthe
imposition of tenement rates, and the tenant will have
to bear the brunt of the increasing costs by way of
higher room rent—which is what he tries to avoid by
staying outside the city. The problem of the poor tenant
can be resolved by:

(1) providing low cost houses financed froma special
levy on the firms, industries and all other em-
ployers of labour in proportion to the junior
workers employed;
rent control—a rent control tribunal is already.
set up but it is yet to solve the new problems
being created by landlords who circumvent the .
rent law by ejecting old tenants under some
guise only to release the rooms to new tenants
agreeable to a higher rent.*

The rural-urban fringe of Lagos is the most critical
zone with respect to development planning in the
metropolis because it is the home of the bulk of the
junior employees and because its development will
determine to a large extent the capacity of Lagos to ~
absorb more population and her rate of spatial and
economic expansion. oe

T has been said several times before that the African
who comes to the United States as a student is first
and foremost not a student. He is a diplomat, an expert
on Africa, and then a student—all in that order. He is
not a diplomat or expert just for or on his nation, but
rather on the entire continent of Africa. At parties and
outside the classroom he is an all-knowing authority
and a soldier to defend Africa. One area where the
African student dispenses his “expertise knowledge” is
in African politics. Another area is with the African
family. Particularly significant in this regard are poly-

gamy and the payment of bride-wealth, both of which -

have been slanted and interpreted in tones which, to
the African, particularly the African woman, depict pity
and arouse horror at the way African men treat their
women,

The other night I was invited to a dinner party. There
were three couples—the Richards, the Stevens, and the
Thompsons—and then Sally and Jean, two single girls.
~ The two girls were very beautiful, and Sally wore a
very simple dress which made her even more ravishing.
As we were introduced our eyes lingered on at each
other—even if only for a split of a second. “This is the
friend from Africa?” Mrs Richards asked. “We had a
friend some time back in the East Coast who had been
a missionary to Africa for several years. He enjoyed his
stay very much and he brought back very many art
pieces and slides of Africa.”

“Talking about our missionary friend reminds me of
a question I have been wanting to ask an African,” the
husband said. “This question of polygamy. You know,
one man marrying many wives... .”” He was interrupted
by a cough from his wife.

“One man marrying more than one wife: My-oh-
my! That is cheating on the part of the husband,”
opined Mrs Thompson.

“What fun!” remarked Mr Richards.

“What about the African woman? Can she also
marry more than one husband?” asked Mrs Stevens.

50

“And do you also know that the African pays some
money for his wife?” rejoins the first lady, with an
all-knowing attitude.

“Paying money for your wife?” asked Jean, one of
the single girls. _

“That is like buying your wife. The parents of the
bride are sort of selling their daughters then. How
awful,” Mrs Thompson added.

“What of our dowry system?” Sally, the single girl
in the simple dress, spoke for the first time.

“Well...” The second lady was lost in words.
Then, on a second thought, “Well, you cannot really
regard our dowry system as being an equivalent of
what happens over there.”

“How is it different?” I asked. :

“Well, at least we are civilized about the way we do
ours,” she became defensive. :

“What do you mean ‘civilized’ 2” asked Sally.

“At least we have a purpose for it and it serves a
function. But ‘over there’ in Africa what purpose could
you Africans have for a dowry other than to give you
men a license to treat your spouse as an inferior person
—like a slave. To compound the humiliation you
marry several wives.”

“But the African woman even encourages her hus-
band to marry more wives,” I added.

“The African woman encourages polygamy? You
must be joking. Think of it. Me sharing my husband
with other women! How awful.” : }

“You must be aware of the existence of call girls in
western society. And you must have heard of the role
they serve well-bred family men when the latter are
on business trips. You must have heard of company
conferences which a husband attends in another city
such as the married man in San Francisco going on a
business trip to Chicago, New York, Detroit, Miami,

MONEY WITHOUT TEARS

By

Kora ADEBAYO

OSEPH Adio, a contented-looking, well-fed
P.R.O. for Eagle Airlines sat at his desk on one cold
Wednesday morning.

A little numbness with cold made him pat his pocket
for the ever-present cigarette case. He brought it out,
stuck one of the cigarettes on his lower lip, then he
snapped alight his RONSON lighter.

There was a knock that made him pause on his
office door. “Come in,” He said shortly and lit his
cigarette. He inhaled deeply and released smoke
through wide, flaring nostrils and thick lips. Anita
Brown, Joseph’s pert secretary came in with the duck-
tail gait and announced the arrival of John Kwame.
“Kwame?!” Joseph asked, elated but alert. John Kwame
was once a member of the same club with Joseph. He
was a P.R.O. with FORTS—the firm that makes steel
safes. He was relieved of his appointment with them
when they caught him on a wrong foot. “Show him
in, Anita.” Joseph notice disapproval on Anita’s face.
He dragged more smoke into his lungs. When Anita
does not agree with a visitor’s appearance, she scowls.
The door opened and the tall figure of Kwame came in.
“Hello, Joe. Long time no see!”

“Hello Kwame. Take a seat or won’t you sit?” Joseph
noticed that Kwame’s coat was frayed at the cuffs.
Maybe this was why Anita did not approve of him.
“Will you have a cigarette?” Joseph asked bringing out
his gunmetal cigarette case.
“Err, well I'll have one.” He selected one from the case,
accepted light from Joseph and began to smoke conten-
tedly,
“Well?” Joseph asked after a while.
“Oh yes. Ihave come to discuss an affair which we shall
both benefit from if the idea succeeds.”

“Alright, go ahead.” Joseph said. He crushed. out the
stub of cigarette and listened attentively.

“What could be your reaction if a gift of £2,000 is
thrown onto your lap?” Kwame asked looking directly
at Joseph’s eyes.
“Is that a joke or what?” Joseph asked, not believing
his ears.

Why, he thought. This man with a frayed coat who
cannot afford to buy a new one comes to ask such a
silly question. Well, at least it costs nothing to be
attentive.

“Go on,” Joseph urged.

“T have a plan. Is it safe to discuss here?”’ Kwame asked.

“Not here in my office,” Joseph said. “That secretary of
mune is a snooper, for all I know, she might have been

. eavesdropping already.”

53

“Okay Joe, relax. Soon, she won't snoop again for long.
Where can we talk?”

ALFRED’ is ideal.”

“Alright Joe, sce you at Alfred’s tonight at 7 p.m.”
Kwame stood up and moved with lopping strides to
the door. He opened it and was in time to see Anita
dash back to her seat. He glared at her and quickened his |
pace. Then, he was gone.

Alfred’s is an out-of-the-way bar for those who
want to have an affair with dubious publicity. The
wife who wants to flirt or the man who wants to snatch
a little fun. The soft lighting, good wine and chatting
customers made a pleasant background to the noise of
the juke box.

Promptly at 7 0’ clock, Joseph Adio walked in

ARBOUR DAYS

During the month of May
All the days are arbour days

Drilled to the forestérs’ sway
In all we know are his ways.

From the nurseries to the farms
The crops have tender handling,

And woe-be-tide he who harms
The tender roots of a sapling.

With the tenderest care the saplings
Are planted in their well dug holes -

And the planters proud with ardent feelings
The plants will be healthy without whorls.

When all day drizzling rain followed .~
Alternating sunshine they muse with delight
What the elements in approval hallowed
To promote success without the least plight.

“HALF-A-WORD’

I'll tell you ‘half-a-word’
which the elders say

Is enough for the wise
For when,

It is digested

It becomes full whole

Now,

In that your place
Where sour is given for sweet
Sincerity lacks foundation
‘Give-and-take’ seek admirers
I say

Your conscience

Is the real judge

Here,
my ‘half-a-word’

Man moves about in a world

That is not his own

And revels in abysmal ignorance;

He gropes his way about,

Stumbling at various points;

But still he tries to find his way
In this vast wilderness of Life.

He knows not what he wants—

No vague idea whatsoever;

He sees but does not appreciate,

He hears but does not understand;

He hears so many voices in his inner self

But knows not which one to obey
In this vast wilderness of Life.

He knows, yet he does not know,
He is happy, yet he is sad,
He is a success, yet a failure;
But still he moves doggedly along;
Oh! when will Man learn
To pick his way with ease

In this vast wilderness of Life.

movement kept everybody in their houses in that
great night.

He was thinking that he would win the war, but
it was not so. To plan a war is a technical job that
requires strategy. When he got nearer, he saw the red
object but he never knew that something of that
nature would be there. He stooped down, trying to
know what it was. Bending forward and backward,
right and left, then he stood up. He marched forward
a bit, then stood. He murmured to himself: “Maybe
this thing is gold, or what?” Because of the moonlight
that shone on it, it was glowing. When he went up to a
foot from it, then he could know that it was a human
being’s private part. .

he could not run. He was jamming houses, rolling on the

morning women who went for fishing in the river told
the townspeople that they saw a dead body in the river
floating, the corpse was not quite a human body and
not like an animal’s.

Besi the faithful wife saved her husband from the

man died, no more coming back, forever. Besi and her
husband lived a happy and prosperous life till their

he wrote to Bridges:

“Since I must not flatter or exaggerate, I do not
claim that you have such a volume of imagery as
Tennyson, Swinburne or Morris, though the feeling
for beauty you have seems to me pure and exquisite,
but in point of character, of sincerity or earnestness,
of manliness, of human feeling, you have what
they have not and seem scarcely to think worth
having.” !

It is thus clear that Hopkins knew the literature of his
day and had an expressed opinion on what its worth
was. He was ever indignant at what he termed the
waste of talent evident in the lack of pathos and sincerity
and in the abundance of artificiality, affectation, mawk-
ishness of his contemporaries, in the midst of several
fine opportunities for imagery and proper diction that
could have gone into the making of great poetry. The
poets of his day had nothing to be serious about, he felt.
Tennyson’s “gift of utterance is truly golden but go
home and you find thoughts commonplace
_ and wanting in nobility.”? It is “genius uninformed
by character.” Swinburne he graded as “plague of
mankind” who repeatedly came off badly. Indeed, his
“genius is astonishing but words are only words and
_ €verything he writes is rigmarole for he does not express
feeling, much less character.” On this score, he wrote
Bridges saying:

“Swinburne has a new volume out which is
teviewed in its own style: ‘the rush and the rampage,
the pause and the pull up of these lustrous and
lumpophorous lines.’ It is all now a ‘self-drawing
web’ a perpetual functioning of genius without
truth, feeling or any adequate matter to be at function

to nature, to human nature, is frigid. Now he has
ot a great deal of what came in with Kingsley and
the Broad Church school, a way of talking (and
making his people talk) with the air of a man bounc-

sense.””4
Hopkins did not like Carlyle’s “pampered and affected
style, 1 hate his principles, I burn most that he worships
and worship most that he burns.... but the force of
his genius seems to me gigantic.”® Dickens was too
mawkish, had no true command of pathos. Stretching
his invectives across the gamut of Victorian literature
and sensibility, he complained to Bridges “this Victorian
English is bad business.” They say “it goes without
saying.” Instead of “no such thing, they say non-
existent; in for at and altruistic and a lot more. Disillu-
sion is a bad word, you mean disenchantment. It is as
bad as ordeal and preventative and stand-point and other
barbarisms.” This is the venom of a stung sensitivity,
the fangs of a fierce fighter, tearing, rampaging and
devastating whatever he considered unsuitable to the
good taste. And often not much was suitable for such
good tastes. Hopkins criticized Bridges’ diction in
The Dead Child arguing that “indeed, ‘wise sad head’
and ‘firm, pale hands’ do not strike me as severe at all,
nor yet exquisite, Rather they belong to a familiar

‘commonplace about ‘reader, have you never hung

over the pillow of. . . .pallid cheeks, clammy brows. ...
long long night-watches.... surely Sir Josiah Bicker-
staff, there is some hope....O say not all is over.
It cannot be’.”® Having had such defined ideas about
contemporary literature it was only fair that Hopkins
should establish his own poetic code. In doing this,
he went all out to carve out a language of poetry for
himself and his followers against an age he felt was
befogged with irrelevant embroidery, compromise
and complacency. He stood out, poised to wage the
war, for which his rebellious nature was adequately
suited,
He knew the life about him so well, and gave it
expression; the landscape, the lakes, a starlight night,
spring, a skylark, May, air, trees, sacrifice, resurrection,
peace, patience, beauty, despair, loneliness, Oxford, etc.
It was the knowing and probing spirit-force that chas-
tised the flesh in the Wreck of the Deutchland, the same
spirit in hiding which ‘went all out for the “dapple-
dawn-drawn falcon
in his riding of the rolling level
underneath him

of scintillating “‘goose step.”

Of the eight girl dancers only four of the female
dancers hold the calabashes while the other four
each have rattles tied to each limb which in due
course form part of the expression of this famous

As the music warms up to a tempo, the “braves”

dancers stop singing and with one sudden preci-

there in 1969.

The horn blower warns the dancers to get ready

The leader in one spectacular tenor summons the

float, really great, we must see our light before wé die,
God is with us.”

He did not disclose the underground reason of their
immediate riches, however, Besi, his gift of God
suspected something of that nature, but not quite.
They started to carry the money to their hut with
uncovered boxes they picked from the dustbin. As
soon as they finished carrying the moncy, the church
clock started to waken the sleepers for their day-
businesses. At that very moment, they found that the
palm-leaves house became a block building. It was longer
and wider, as big as a business firm, but two rooms as it
was. They went round to see its beauty and departed.

When they reached where their hut was, a certain
mighty, furnitured three stories beautiful building had
taken its place. The husband said to his wife: “This
is our new house instead of the former hut, let us
enter.” They got into the house with happiness, and

-went round the whole building. Each floor had fourteen,
rooms plus a parlour, and twostores, very mighty it was.

Poor man and his faithful wife Besi who were to be
exiled by the townspeople because of poverty started
their refined lives on that day. All molestation, assault,
hunger, mosquito bite and nickname disappeared like a
dream. This wonderful event gave the inhabitants
a shock, it was beyond their thought. That day was a
great day for the whole town, nobody went to bush,
some were happy and some were disappointed. They
did not know what to say against him, because if they
said, he was a thief, a thief could not steal two mighty
buildings and no building was missing in the town. So
the townspeople left him to enjoy his life.

As the man had become a man of popularity, he
started to receive confessions, those who were treating
him with scorn were confessing and apologizing
before him, This man was very glad to see that many
evil-doers started to repent for their wickedness and
were making confession. The man pasted a notice on
the gateway to his splendid edifice, it read thus: “Every
creature is welcomed, forgiveness is at my door, God
created every high and low, no one is greater, this is an
example for every individual, Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome!” His old friend who lent him the axe was
one of those who confessed.

The fame went round the whole area spreading far
and wide, so everybody was coming to Okrika to

126

experience the scene by hirnself or herself. They had |
heard and had seen many other wonderful events but _
this was too great. |
Besi’s parents always had disagreement in their
house. If they were in need of something like money,
the husband would say: “My wife, ‘you have spoiled —
everything, if not so, we would have found favour
from our son-in-law. He is now the richest man in this —
town, but I am ashamed of myself. Besi, our daughter
too told you that you should not be worried, but still
you were abusing him. You said that he was dead —
among the living, look at yourself now. What are you? _
Are you not dead among the living? Even I advised ©
you not to worry him, but you were not listening to
my adyice. Your buttocks did not rest on the seat like a
person who took purgative,” 7
- The wife would say: “My husband, forgive me, I
never knew that he would become a rich man, and on _
the other hand, I was trying to pity our daughter Besi.
Since you are a man, please go to him to beg for
forgiveness.” The husband would say: “Tf you beg him, —
he will forgive you because many people have gone to ©
him to apologize and they were welcome.” These two
people were doing their ‘who will bell the cat’ every-_
day.
Well, if the hand winds the foot, the hand will not _
be cut off, so Besi and her husband came to the parents —
and gave them much money and supplied them all
their needs, They did not ask them anything for what
they did to them, especially, the mother, because their _
sins were already forgiven.
The water man continued carrying the money for —
the poor man. This man became the richest man in the
town. He built many houses for the poor and fed
them. He took care of all the orphan children. He —
became the most popular man in the town, and later j
on, they appointed him the king of the town. The king —
was very happy, but his seven-year agreement with —
the water man always knocked at his head, whereas
the wife was just on top water, enjoying. They were —
enjoying the sweetest life that any person would —
enjoy until it came to a time when he was sure of j
trouble, with only two days left. |
He refused to eat and drink. The wife started to ask ;
him what might have happened to him. She said: —
My dear, what is the matter with you: Could you _
remember our past days when we were wandering _

of my life, I never knew that the world is‘hard. I grew
up rapidly with happiness and became an independent
man. You yourself were very pleased for your daughter
to marry me. Now my glory has faded away. I am like
the flower in the garden. I have become the poorest
man in this town. Not only you, almost everybody
in this town always laughs at me with abusive words.
And some people stone me or kick me at their houses.
You call me the dead among the living, yes, my in-law,
that is my name, but bear in mind that it is written that
everything has its own season. There is a time for
happiness and a time for sorrow.

“Though, the world has built an iron wall across my
way that I should not pass. I am poor but I have hope
in the future still. I know that I will become a rich man
- in future because I dreamt last night that I was counting
money. They say that sometimes dreams come true.
That time when you see us, you will smile and be
proud of us.” The woman could not know what to do,
so she returned home shamefully.

The poor man one day went to his old friend. This
_ man was his best friend among all the friends he had

when he was a bit rich. He said: “Please my friend,
I humbly beg you to lend me your axe, matchet and
canoe to go to the opposite side to cut firewood for
sale.” His friend said: “Who is that beast? Get away
from my sight! Am I your friend: I am with better
people, don’t disturb us. We are discussing something
that will benefit us in life, I don’t want to hear anything
from a useless creature of your type. Would you
approach me if you were good! I don’t know why
that foolish Besi is still marrying this mad dog,”

The poor man said: “Please don’t be annoyed with
me, when I was rich, you were my best friend, don’t
treat me badly as the others do. I am dying of hunger,
since morning I have not tasted anything. A man
should not be proud of his riches. I was once a rich man.
Inever knew that I would become a poor and wretched
man. If you give me, I will not waste much time, just
small firewood for sale.” The people who were with
him too helped the poor man to beg him for his

request.

The man said: “Before I give you these things,
you must do certain work for me. Take my bucket to
the waterside and fetch me water.” The poor man
happily took the bucket and fetched the water for the

man. The man asked the poor nian to follow him with
the bucket of water. They walked along the road until
they got to the poor man’s little hut. The man said:
“Pour the water on the floor of your hut, if you really
want me to grant your request.”

The poor man helplessly poured the water on the
floor of his own hut because he was badly in need of
the said materials. Besi was standing outside looking at
the commander and her husband who was busy
watering the floor. The people from the neighbouring
houses started to laugh at Besi and her poor husband
saying: “Look at these foolish couple, it serves them
well, this night you will not sleep in your dirty hut,
and your days are numbered.” Tears ran out from
poor Besi'*heavy eyes, she was not in this world, she
stood still,

After that, the man said: ‘tis all right, now, follow
me to my house and take the materials.” The poor
man followed him to the house, there he gave him
the things. The poor man took the things happily
and went down to the waterside, got into the canoe
and crossed the river,

He tied the canoe and got into the mangrove forest.
When he reached a certain area, he stood and looked
round and found that he could hardly cut the type of
wood that would suit the purpose, for the axe was
extremely blunt, and it was doubtful whether ever
the matchet also could cut the thinnest rope. As he was
thinking what step to take, his small friends mosquitoes
and sandflies were humming around and pestering
him, He nearly burst into tears because of the happiness
of his small friends of the forest. He moved forward
a bit and saw a piece of dried wood fallen across the
path. Instead of him to return home empty handed since
Besi never tasted any food before he left her, he deter-
mined to cut a log, so that when he reached home, he
would chop it for sale.

There he started to cut the wood, but rat’s bite was
sharper than the axe’s cut. As he was cutting the wood,
the insects were feasting on his uncovered skin.

After about an hour of struggling with these, he
heard someone approaching. On hearing the approach-
ing foot steps, the woodcutter murmured to himself q
saying: “Who is that coming? Maybe it isa killer, ora
fairy. I could remember, long long ago, somebody
told me that this type of thick forest is a hiding place
for forestmen who kill animals as well as men.” He

big occasions in Kamana.

Jenkinson looked at him in a new light.

“May I have the pleasure of letting them off this
time, Your Honour?” Sadig looked at the Chief. They
both grinned, while the Judge, Mustapha, turned
quietly away to hide the grin on his face. After the last
celebration, there had been a lengthy case before his
Court which involved a claim for £17 damages for one
burned gown, Sadig v. Prince Isiah. _

Both were older and calmer now, as the Chief
Nodded graciously and said, “It pleases us.”

So they worked quietly away, and the programme

At length Chief Isiah nodded to the Secretary, who
shut up his Minute Book. ,

“As this we will make the last occasion on which
the Council will meet before our Formal Eve of
Independence meeting, I think we can safely leave
matters to the D.O. and his committee. Shall we
adjourn?”

“Chief, there is one small point I would like to
mention,” Jenkinson looked rather more embarrassed
and starchy than usual.

“Please D.O.2 go ahead.”

“As, well, you know you people are celebrating
your release fom the the British and all that, and, er,
wouldn’t you rather that I didn’t appear in the pro-
ceedings,” words came with a sudden, untypical
rush, “feel freer without me and that sort of thing?”

There was a sudden quictness as the scrape of chairs
stopped, i

The Secretary quietly opened his book again.

* “Stand still a moment please, all members.” The Chief
was a small man in height but with an authority which
transcended the young Englishman’s embarrassment.

“T wish the Secretary to record carefully what I am
saying. The D.O. is the Representative now of a

jack. He will then hoist the Nigerian Flag and become
the Representative of the Nigerian Government.

perfect order. “What of the generator?” Dele asked.

Similar tests were made, but there was nothing to indicate
that that mechanism was out of order. So Salau could
not figure out the problem. They all left the car in his
charge so that he could apply his expert knowledge.

After performing various tricks he came out to tell
the others of his inability to locate the ailment of the
vehicle. For two hours they were trying to find the fault,
but all were to no avail. Then Dele asked Salau to check
the petrol tank once more and there was nothing left!
They had run out of petrol without knowing it! That
was the beginning of their problems for they were in
‘the centre of nowhere, and gas was not the cheapest
commodity on that junction. Dele was so embarrassed
by the situation that he said that one should never trust a
machine. =

They sat together and Dele ordered their lunch
~ because it was then after 1.00 p.m. Jide brought the
hefty picnic box, and the cold water flask, but only
Tiger was hearty enough to eat to satisfaction. They were
faced with the possibility of not reaching Idofin that
day. But they put their heads together on what to do.
It was decidéd that Jide should go to Mokwa to pur-
chase two gallons of petrol while the rest of them would +
stay behind to dream of other ideas.

There were lots of day-dreaming on the part of every-
one, but that of Salau was supposedly better since he was
the only expert among them.

He put his ideas to them that although the engine was
designed to use petrol he could remember that he once
used. diesel oil when apprenticed to a van driver a few
years back. Dele doubted this. He asked, “How can a gas
engine run on diesel oil?” But what happened later
would go along way to confirm that some so-called
experts are sometimes gsimateurs at their own trades,

Before they could put this theory into practice, Jide
was back, He was given a lift by a motor cyclist. His
errand was dutifully executed, but petrol had become
a rare bird in Mokwa, and due to local shortage, there
was a serious rationing in Jebba too. .

Often times frustration leads to desperation, and
desperation to confusion but at other times these things
work in reverse to a hopeful point. Dele’s earlier doubts
in Salau’s bogus theory gave way to hopeful belief that
certain ideas which seemed incredible sometimes resulted
in success. He felt he should not have doubted whether

146

x

the oil would work or not. But that was the beginning of
fresh headaches.

They waved to the first available van to purchase some
diesel oil, at least one gallon to take them to the nearest
station. Fidelis Rano-the-Driver, who was travelling
from Kano to Lagos, sold one gallon of diesel oil to them

at double the price in Kano, where he made his original

purchase. He contended that the oil shoild be more
expensive at_that point where he met them than it
was further north, But the truth was that he used that to
make hot money and as a matter of fact he twisted his
story to match the occasion. Diesel oil ought to be
cheaper in JéBba than Kano, being closer to the coast.
This, notwithstanding, they gave him the money and
he confirmed Salau’s fable that ordinary petrol engine
could function on diesel oil.

They emptied the gallon, packed-all their scattered
lunch equipments to goon to Jebba. But when an attempt
was made to start the engine, there was neither spark,
hor sound, the car remained there. It had become a
small god to be worshipped, an idol to be
precise.

Fidelis Rano-the-Driver ther was miles away from
them, Salau became pensive, Sanmi very calm, Jide
uneasy, Tiger playing with insects, and Dele became
fed-up with the whole thing. The sum was already
down and the day well spent, and the local people from
Mokwa soon began to arrive at that point to watch the
stranded strangers, The prospect of sleeping in such a
lonely road junction infested with night marauders was
immediately ruled out as soon as the questions was put
to Dele. For it would amount to giving up oneself to |
anything that could happen he thought. 7

This led to sharp exchange of words between Salau
and the rest of the party, and Dele went on to ridicule
his technical know-how; but the dialogue was stopped
abruptly by the arrival in a jeep of an expatriate Agri-
cultural Officer attached to Mokwa farm centre. They @
asked him for some petrol but they were disappointed
to learn that he, too, had only one gallon to last him to
Bida, and he could not tisk getting into the same kind
of trouble.

That was indeed distressing, because his story could
not have been the truth, but there was no way of detec-
ting, except that, there was a container at the rear
of his Jeep, which seemed to be a petrol drum. Anyway
he left without even offering any assistance and must

about and get filled (with wine)”. The Creoles’

happened not to be tee-to-tallers, and Yoruba

_ folk were sure that Creole (Krio) was analysable

..into the Yoruba phrase Kiri yé. That, again, is
Popular etymology.

In the same way, they called Islam imdle, a
word they interpret as imé lile “hard doctrine’’.
Islam, they said, was brought by jihad warriors
Who came with the Qur’an in one hand and the
Sword in the other. The choice, they said, was
hard. Hence, they say, Islam is called imdle.
This etymology seemed to fit until Yoruba Mu-

Slim intellectuals began to puncture the ex-
Planation. Jmdle, they said, was the word Mali,
the name of the country from where the first
Muslim missionaries to the Yorubas came. As
the Yorubas could not understand the word
Mali, they identified it with the Yoruba phrase
Which sounded like it.

During the Second World War, the word
German was often heard by the Yorubas. Yoruba
folk relayed the word in their popular versions
of the war news: for German they produced
YO marin “five days”. Interesting, as usual, but

_ Only the completely monolingual Yoruba did
believe that the word German was the Yoruba
Phrase ijé mdrim “five days”. This again illus-
trates folk etymology which seeks the derivation
of a word and therefore its true meaning in

Whatever the word sounds like in the language
familiar to the folk etymologist.

When the Late Adegoke Adelabu made the
Statement about something which he said was
a “peculiar mess”, his puzzled audience was
‘ntrigued by the phrase. It became one of the
Man’s nicknames: Ibadan folk and drummers
falled him Adelabu Adegoke penkele méési!

€ ideophone “penkele” sounds interesting,
Ut it is not helpful in a discussion of the deri-

Vation and the true meaning of the English

Word “peculiar” which was beyond the level of

Sruba folk comprehension. ;

When Major-General Yakubu Gowon became
_ Head of State, the name Gowon naturally became

_  Rousehold word, But the name is not Hausa,

Hot Yoruba, not English. “What in the world

‘S Gowon?” thought the puzzled Yoruba folk.

>

149

Some folk etymologist started the fad that Gowon
meant “Go on”. The Civil War situation pro-
vided the legend to support’ this etymology: it
was said that the Head of State was so called
because he was expected to “go on” with “the
task that must be done’”-—to keep Nigeria one!
Extremely interesting, but wide of the mark
philologically.

It was interesting to listen to Hubert Ogunde
singing of Azikiwe, igi iwé; it was enough as
far as Yoruba folk were concerned to explain
the Igbo name, Azikiwe. Circumstances abetted
popular fancy, for Dr Azikiwe really knew his
books. He was an igi iwé, “‘a tree of books”.
Who cannot see that igi iwé “sounds like” Azi-
kiwe? Why look further than the Yoruba
language for the derivation of Dr Azikiwe’s
name? And if there comes a person who is bilin-

‘gual in Igbo and Yoruba and says, “Not at all.

The name is not Yoruba; it is Igbo”, he will

.be told what the people told Paul: “Paul, Paul,

too much learning has made you mad”’.

The Late Hon. S. L. Akintola made his point
when in a flood of Yoruba oratory he implied
in his radio speeches that the Igbo name Jke-
Jjiani meant ikeji 4 ni, “The second one will have”. .
He coined the names iketadni, ikerindni, and
the effect was hilarious. This was “popular ety-
mology with an eye to propaganda”’.! 3

Rascally boys who trespassed on to Roman
Catholic Mission yards and had to cry “I beg
your pardon” joked that the English sentence
meant J bé ’gi l’egba pddadi, “I cut trees in the
compound of the padre’”—which was what some
of them did and got into trouble. And the people —
of Ibadan popularized the name of the Ibadan
Boys’ High School as Ibadan, bi o sd n sikiit,
“Tbadan, if you play truant from school”, a
prodosis which they rounded off with the apo-
dosis o 6 re ’lé kéu, “You will go to the Qur’anic
School”. The only inference we can make from
that is non-etymological: it is that the Ibadan
Boys’ High School in its early days had notorious
rascals who often played truant from school,
and that the school had many Muslim pupils.

_ Own joy, button-holing the reader. Dr Pick comments
__ that Hopkins “‘uses almost a new language and_ doesn’t
_ Provide a Dictionary.”* Hopkins did not nced to
_ produce any Dictionary; although for purposes of
Clarity, he tried to facilitate the reading of his poetry
by indicating the stresses until the practice became irri-
tating to publishers. He nevertheless saw imagery and
good poetic form as inseparable from true poetic
experience since the image is given with emotion and
flushed by it. Thits the image is embodied in a poem
as a living part arid the language used by a poet must
have the same individualizing touch as the matter of
his poetry, matter and form being one and inseparable.
Hopkins’ poetry and his language needed the approach
ak one who understands his tenets of writing, because
his language was new to his world and age though his
techniques are no longer new today.

“Our century,” says Elizabeth Atkins “likes thorny

tangled poetry like that of Donne and Hopkins”®

€cause perhaps we live in a thorny and tangled century
Wherein our private and public concerns are reflected

“Tt is a hawk....” :

Francis Macguire, evidently a scholar of Hopkins
“Glory be to God” school voices his theme nicely
in “These Things”:

Clive Sanson also fashions his “Seagulls” after the

“Windhover” but while Hopkins lets his bird ply home

lone and beautiful, Sanson directs his Seagull bird by

radio speed counselling it to return at “Schoneider”’
speed.

Hopkins’ precocity is thus borne put by the wealth
and plurality of the heritage he bequeathed poetry and
criticism in the twentieth and subsequent centuries.
“The principles of art are eternal while the principles
of morality fluctuate with the spiritual ebb and flow
of the. ages.” Hopkins evolved radical innovations
diametrically critical of existing Victorian writing —
standards. He demonstrated his total rejection of ortho-
doxy by the show-down on the Church of England
which'led him to the extremes of becoming a Roman
Catholic spiritual. But even as a Catholic priest, Hopkins
constituted his own institution with dual allegiance: to
his God and his Ego. This is abundantly illustrated by
his various preoccupations. “I am glad you go to
confession” he wrote to Urquhart “although there is _
nothing of a Sacrament in the ordinance as you use
it, but it still has its value ex opere operantis. . . .but this
kind of reasoning is dangerous and likely to mislead.”

‘This kind of reasoning is certainly likely to mislead.

But definitely that kind of reasoning can only mislead
the uninitiated, and not one like Hopkins who already
knew what the true story was. In a single subtle move,
Hopkins had cast a shadow of doubt on the authenticity
of the basic sacerdotal prerogative: the priests’ right to
hear confessions and forgive sins, a notable score for an
inside Outsider. Gerard Manley Hopkins of course was
a priest of God who heard confessions and forgave sins.

ARTS FESTIVAL

— Maiduguri, 1970

By

~

Mariam Usman ADEBAYO DUROSINLORUN

ESTIVALS in the lives of Nigerians are

unique occasions. What makes them unique.

is no more than their aesthetic qualities—the very
cord that binds the people securely within the
community.

To a State like the North-Eastern State of
Nigeria with 8 million people noted for its rich
culture and traditional heritage, its diverse people
and ethnic affiliations, the festival serves as a
symbolic base on which the unity of the State
rests.

When on May 12, 1970 artistes from all corners
of the State assembled in Maiduguri to take part
in the year’s Festival of the Arts it was the belief
that this noble ideal of cementing unity on a
firmer base was being demonstrated. For artistes
consisting of dancers, jugglers and singers came
from as far as Baissa, 600 miles away on the

Mambilla Plateau down to the plains of Shani in .

Biu Division and thence to Duguri in Bauchi
Province to engage in healthy competition in this
annual cultural festival.

In his opening speech, the Governor of the
North-Eastern State, Colonel Musa Usman,
observed that within the context of African
Society, art in its diverse forms plays a significant
role in the life of the community. “It is an anvil on
which unity can be forged.”

If this togetherness emphasized the ideals of
unity in diversity, yet the aesthetic experience

13

generated by such togetherness was more compel-
ling. For instance their dances were performed
under strict and congenial atmosphere of keen
competition. The rendition of songs was most
prolific and of course the display of artifacts from
various parts of the State was a testimony to their
contribution to the world of art.

Conscious of the role Festival of Arts generates,
the Government of the North-Eastern State gave
a subvention to the tune of £6,000 to the State’s
branch of the Nigerian Arts Council under whose
auspices the festival was held.

Talking about highlights, each year, there
emerges something new and something spectacu-
lar. This year, the Kekeri dancers, with captivating
rhythm and poetic capers of their dances,
captured the admiration of all. The dancing group
consisted of eight male and eight female dancers
from Shani in Biu Division. The dance was
“the Coming of Age” dance performed every year
mostly in December in Shani to emphasize that a
youth has come of age and can now marry.

The dance begins when the leader summons his
group in one short solo and then in a single file,
the “‘braves”’ sword in right hand, and two spears
tied together in the left and all bedecked with other
accoutrements, lead the dance in a gentle shuffle.

The girl dancers equally bedecked in dancing
accoutrements also join the dance in another
single file, this time, with a calabash in hand and

bably amounted to a gradual assumption of power
over grasslands where certain grazing rights and
privileges had been granted them, built up the
huge Bornu empire of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. — .

It was the Bulala who had been one of the
reasons of the decline of this empire and the
evacuation of Kanem and although Kanem had

been reconquered and the Bulala defeated, the

capital remained at Gazargamu which during the
following years kept the Tuareg and Kwararafa
at bay amongst other enemies. During the eigh-
teenth century the power of Bornu dwindled and
the presence of the Fulani from the west grew so
that by the time the Sokoto reformer Usman dan
Fodio turned to military methods and gave flags
to his followers throughout Hausaland and Bornu,
the Fulani already presented a grave problem to
the Mai.

was Gwani Mukhtar who lived in the neighbour-
hood of where Damaturu was later to be built.
In the northwest was Abdua and when the Mai
sent his two generals, the Galadima and the
Kaigamma, against him the Bornu forces suffered
a serious reverse. They later recovered however
and Abdua was killed. In 1806 Gwani Mukhtar
was given a flag by dan Fodio and on his return he
commenced attacking Bornu under the general
direction of a Gombe Fulani called Buba Yero.
The Mai’s original strategy was to support the
border states along the periphery of Bornu against
the ‘Fulani and thus form a buffer between the
Fulani and Bornu proper. This would have been
possible in the northwest, had the Mai possessed
the strength, for at that stage the Hausa states had
not been overrun completely by the Fulani. But
the Mai’s army was too weak and when Gwani
Mukhtar was given his flag there was no buffer
state between his forces and Bornu.

Conclusion

Bearing in mind that poetry precedes ar and

having seen these deviations in Hausa poetry which
cannot be accounted for in the Arabic Prosody, and
being from only one metre, I am convinced that Hausa
poetry deserves a separate prosody. This task falls
squarely on the shoulders of our prominent ‘scholars
some of whom are with us here.

I gratefully acknowledge the valuable help and

encouragement I got from Dr M. K. Galadanci and
Mallam M. A. Makoushy both of the English and
languages Departments of Abdullahi Sato aise
Kano.

curious footrest, carved out of marble—. It is carved
out of one piece of stone and is carefully finished and
polished. When Ife was destroyed by the Modakekes,
this stool, with two others, one somewhat similar in
form, and the other of simple four legs, were concealed
among some long grass and partially buried, so that
they might not fall into the hands of their enemies.
It was in this position I saw them first, The projection is
broken off from one stool, but the one with the four
legs is intact.”*! Obviously, many public treasures
suffered the fate of these objects.

Finally, the fact that Ile-Ife was practically non-
existent at the time when the British were beginning to
penetrate into the Yoruba interior was to have intere-
sting consequences for the political status of Ife and the
political history of the Yoruba under the British.
In spite of the high regard which all Yoruba people
continued to have for Ife as their ancestral home and for
its ruler as the oldest among the brotherhood of Yoruba
rulers, the position of Ife was never really understood
by the British, influenced as they were by the picture of

Ife which they had first known in the last years of the

nineteenth century. It was not until the Yoruba began to

be responsible for their own affairs from 1950 on that .

Ife was more or less fully resurrected—its ruler being
made the first African governor of Western Nigeria, and
Ile-Ife being selected as the seat of the university estab-
lished by the region in 1962.

THE SHRINKING ROAD >

OLAYINKA O,. SIMOYAN

S a small boy, Samie had wanted to be a missionary

somewhere in a distant land. Even before he gra-
duated from High School he assisted his father to run a
sinall Baptist Church in Mainlain outside of the city of
St. Clave in Canada. It was at this time that his thoughts
became widened. He also taught in the Sunday School.
For him the Word. was food and life and he read the
Bible avidly each day of his life. His father, the Right
Rev. Samuel Samuelson, the country parson, could not be
happier with the budding man of God. His other three
sons were all the time talking of studying medicine,
engineering, and political science. Until the fourth child
opened his mind to the father, his happiness was not full
because it seemed that no one would take after him.
- Much attention was devoted to Samie not only by his
father, but the mother, a religious woman who grew up
in a Puritan family, was caught in the cobweb too.
Samie was obviously gladdened by the special attention
given him. He was determined to do the best for his God
and his parents. But his interest in missionary work was
to be further sharpened by the arrival on leave of a young
missionary attached to the Christian Mission to Africa.
John Volton Brown had spent four years in the heart of
Nigeria; and had come back to tell the stories of the
people he met and ministered to. Mr Brown spoke at
Mainlain to the young people and also those interested in
Mission work.

Young Samie was moved by what he heard. He
dreamed of those lost natives who knew not the saving
power of his God. Everyday he remembered what Mr
Brown told his group about the sickness of the people,
the poverty and their total ignorance of the True God.
Mr Brown had earlier told Samie’s group “The Young
Missioners”—a body of young men interested in mission
work, that they would help the people of Abita. At
Abita where he worked, they worshipped several
gods, and had only a faint idea of a Great One in the
Skies. Therefore, Samie could hardly wait to get to the

~

field. The field was ripe for him and he had promised his
father that he would join the Christian Mission, to Africa.
After the special service for Mr Brown on the last Sunday
in the Province of Ontario, Samie informed the mis-
sionary that he had volunteered to go into the field.
What a joy that was for Mr Brown who was on a cam-
paign drive fr new missionaries. But young Samie who
had just graduated from High School that June, had
to go through four years of training at the Canadian
Bible College in St, Claire before he could be accepted by
the Christian Mission to Africa,

When Mr Brown got back to the mission headquarters
in Ottawa, he reported to the Secretary the interest young
Samuel Samuelson had in the missionary work. He
advised that the Secretary should be in. touch with
Samie and his family. The Secretary, Rev. Peter Budd, a
former classmate of the Right Rev. Samuel Samuelson
at the Canadian Bible College, praised God for this
young volunteer. He wasted no time in writing his old
classmate and the young missionary-to-be.

Throughout his studies at the Bible College, Samie
remembered very little except the city of Abita in Nigeria
and the sinful pagans. He studied, but prayed daily for
the work of God in this pagan country, and also for the
time he would go out himself to: minister to those lost
in sin.

Meanwhile, Mr Brown returned to his post and he was
sent to Jebba, a small city north of Abita, on returning to
Nigeria. From Jebba he wrote interesting letters te
Samie, narrating to him each time the progress being
made at his new station,

On June 4, 1906, Mr Sammel Samuelson obtained his
diploma from the Bible College. He came an ordained
minister and, therefore, assumed his full name of the
Rey. Samuel Samuelson II. It was a day he would remem-
ber for all his life. Apart from leading his class, he had
the singular honour of being the only student who
volunteered to go to the Mission field, Words of praise

The palace of the Shehu of Bornu as it stands today in Maiduguri

of Cairo before passing on to Mecca and Medina.

Having studied the new movement al-Kanemi
rejected it completely. The Fulani he had seen in
Bornu did not conform to his standards of good
Muslims and moreover, as Bornu was a Muslim
state, he found it abhorrent that Muslims could
wage war on Muslims. His sympathies were wholly
with his Bornu kinsmen and in the 1808 dry
season at the time of the main Fulani invasion of
Bornu he was in fact travelling along the Koma-
dugu Yobe and had quite possibly spent the re-
cent Ramadan fasting in that area.

Gwani Mukhtar and his leaders held a meeting
at Deyo at which they decided how to attack
Bornu and after some preliminary skirmishing
they advanced up the centie and fell on the capital
Gazargamu. The Mai was Muhammad Lefiami
to whom his blind father had voluntarily ab-
dicated six months previously. He fled with his
court down the Yobe and the Fulani entered the
city on Sunday, 12th March, 1808. Theysacked the
city and the Kanuris and their subject populations
scattered. After the first occupation the main
Fulani forces were recalled to Bauchi by Buba

2ExtoZMBZK9IE8y65Hj-,"village are here and waiting for you. We start at the
Fajar prayer tomorrow.”

Three hundred villagers shuffled to the rest house,
driving donkeys, greeting each other in the grey dawn
light among the glimmers of yellow hurricane lamps.
Hubbub prevailed until Garba appeared. Marshalling
his men he led them through the waist high cornfields
to the patch of swampy ground behind the feathery
dom-palms.

Grass mats were spread down wind of the marsh
edge. The sacks were opened and careful measures of
poison stirred into each. Willing hands spread the
mixture smoothly over the mats, covering each as they
lay in a thin line fifty yards away from the breeding
swarm. The bait was laid.

“Now for the drums,” Garba whispered to Jenkin-
son. Quiet orders were given and two-thirds of the
villagers filed away round each side of the swamp.
The red gleams of dawn were now lightening in the
East. Jenkinson looked into the green: speckles of white
began to show like monster daisies on an English lawn.

“The locusts,” said Garba, quietly. “They wake with
the dawn.”

“What do they do now?” asked Jenkinson.

“These settled last week. They liked the ground and
they have bred; now we wait to see the egg hatch, and
the hoppers come. Jump, jump, jump—until they too
get strength, put out their wings and a million more
swarm. They darken the sky, they copulate, lay their
eggs, hatch more millions—and they eat. They will eat
more than we in a year.”

“Allah forbid,” murmured Jenkinson.

“Amin, Amin, European,” replied Garba.

Bang and crash went the drums. To their rhythmic
throbbing the Yo villagers advanced slowly and Jen-
kinson watched fascinated as the daisy-like carpet
hopped towards the line of bait. The carpet appeared
to roll up towards it as blind instinct urged the hoppers
to eat, and with a crackling of wings the poison began
to work. Convulsive shudders shook the two-inch
hammer-headed hoppers, and the edge of the carpet
frayed into tatters.

With a shout the remaining villagers edged forward,
and the stamping of horny feet completed what the
poison had begun.

Me

“Allah is good,” Garba turned to Jenkinson. “We
have killed these. But there are fifty more breeding
grounds.”

For the next ten days Garba’s men and Jenkinson,
working as a team, “lived locust.” Locusts were every-
where, new swarms alighting, breeding, hatching and
hopping to the bait—and, when the bait was exhausted,
to foot-deep trenches lined with villagers stamping —
them with their bare feet and beating them with tree
branches. From five in the morning till noon was past +
and the temperature soared in the 120s: and again in the
evenings until the quick tropical night enveloped them.
Then came the reporting,

The swarms areas were designated on the maps Red
1, Red 2, Red 3 etc., and fresh suspect reports came in
daily to be plotted as Yellow 1, Yellow 2 and Yellow 3.
The mounted messengers shuttled in and out to the
Telegraph Office. Supplies of fresh bran were air- —
dropped by Dakota to the Dropping Lane hacked out

* of the scrub, which was piled into signal fires.

Jenkinson was very proud of the signal fires. At the

. first roar of the engine they’d been lit and the Dakota

circled over low. Piles of sacks were tipped out along
the half mile. Watching with Garba they'd stood on the
lorry and cheered to see the bags dropping in clusters.
Nearer and nearer the clusters came, until there was an _.
undignified scuttle under the tailboard, and the nearest
sack plummetted a bare thirty yards away.

 

Late at night Jenkinson sat with Garba plotting the
swarms on the map. Garba, an old soldier from the
Cameroons, had come to know the Europeans’ absorp-
tion in maps, files and reports. Yellow 5 was thought to
be breeding—Red 2 was hatching. But the worst was
nearly over and the busiest days wee almost past. —

“Have we found Yellow 7 yet:” asked Jenkinson,
“The Commissioner’s asking again.”

“Yellow 72 by the Old Dom Palm Grove?” Garba

~ looked at his note book, ‘yes, they're not hatching yet.”

“Ah—hmm,” muttered Jenkinson.
Duly the report went down; the horseman took it in

to the Telegraph Ries and tap-tap-tap down the
wires it went..

various kinds of energy-sapping formation as the
dance warms up into an incredible tempo.

The North-Eastern State proved to be a veri-
table source of talented musicians and singers.
Though most of the medley of songs are praise
‘songs in vernacular languages and Hausa yet this
successful exercise of bringing musicians under
one umbrella to take part in what was the most
important cultural festival of the year is, I think,
the best way of projecting our cultural heritage.
For instance Gilashi of Azare sings in Hausa and
Pompo from Yola (she is a woman) sings in

native Fulfulde while the boy prodigy from Mubi
and a new attraction to this Year’s Festival would
go places if given all the encouragement.

The cumbersome exercise ‘of bringing the
artistes from all corners of the North-Eastern
State emphasizes the desire of the Government of
the State to achieve unity in diversity which is a
solid foundation for good government.

With this base securely laid, the North-Eastern
State can give a lead in projecting our culture and
traditional heritage not only in the country but
also to the outside world. -

The hot rhythm doles out from the massive GANGA drums as these two drummers of the Banderi dance
group put body and soul together into their famous pastime. Banderi dance is performed during circum-
cision festival which originates from Leko District of Sardauna Province. The Festival usually lasts for two

 

months and is held during the month of May

vUxkoZMBZK9IE8y6tXi1,"that all Hausa poems are, besides the religious ones,
either in praise of some people in a position to reward
the composers or otherwise. This is far from the truth.
We have some poets who compose poems in praise of
their lovers and the like.

Hausa popular songs which are as old as the language
have everything in them but ‘kafiya’. The language had
been in existence centuries before the coming of the
Fulani to this country.

I do not think it convincing enough to conclude that
Hausa poetry is on the same metres as Arabic just
because they both resemble each other in several cases.
Mr M. Hiskett in his paper on Arabic Metres in Hausa
Islamic Verse of June 13, 1969, submitted at a symposium
on Metres and Prosody at the Centre for African
Studies of University of London concludes “that the
bulk of Hausa Islamic verse is composed in the classical
Arabic metres and that the poets do their best to abide
by the rules governing the use of the metres in classical
Arabic poetry”. To me, this conclusion is not in real
conformity with the statement at the beginning of
the paper that “of the sixteen classical Arabic metres
listed by Wright, eleven have been identified in Hausa
verse during the course of my research”. I think that
some reasons should be given to account for the ex-
clusion of the other five metres or the use of the eleven
be regarded as mere coincidence.

_ Hausa poetry on Arabic metres

It can easily be seen that though Hausa poems can be
placed on classical Arabic metres, yet the fact that there
are some deviations not traditional but typical of Hausa
poems is a concrete additional evidence to that of the
exclusion of the five metres, that the classical Arabic
metres are being forced on Hausa poetry for want of
relevant metres. This fact is misinterpreted by Mr
Hiskett where he writes “‘that the poets do their best to
abide by the rules governing the use of the metres. . ,”
in his conclusion quoted above. I have myself composed
not less than a hundred poems before I know anything
of the metres to try to abide by them.

The deviations typical of Hausa poetry mentioned
above can be seen in the following instances on ‘Kamil’
the perfect metre, the second of Mr Hiskett’s eleven.

The poems selected for this anlysis are:

(a) ‘Wakar Ilmin Zamani’ of Ma’azu Hadejia and (b)

‘Arewa’ Mulukiya ko Jumhuriya of Mallam Sa’adu

1. (a) Verse 1 ZF

The first foot of the first hemistich is “Mustafaa

tions of Qata and Tarfiil and a third one, typical of
Hausa poetry, the prolongation of the fifth letter of
the normal foot — ‘i’. This prolongation of the ‘i’ is
seen again in the first foot of the second hemistich of
the same verse.

(b) Verse 5.

vv———/vv—v—
“Ba mutum aljan da malaa’ ikaa.

v0xloZMBZK9IE8y6WniV,"— IFE’S SAD CENTURY

By

Dr S, A. AKINTOYE

he the history of Yorubaland, the nineteenth century

was an era of turmoil and revolution. For these, the
stage was set early in the century by the collapse of the
old Oyo Empire which, in the previous two centuries,
had maintained order over a large part of Yorubaland.
The collapse of this empire and the growth of disorder
in the area over which it had formerly exercised control
coincided with the penetration of the Fulani Jihad into
the northern extremities of Yorubaland—with its seiz-
ure of the important town of Ilorin which its stand-
ard-bearers then used as a base to attempt a conquest
of the troubled country. Among the kingdoms which
had used to be the immediate southern neighbours of
the empire (Owu and Ife) war soon flared up. Moreover,
the situation in these southern areas was to be greatly
complicated by the influx southwards of Oyo people
who were escaping from their troubled homes in the
north and who, apart from flooding many of the old
towns there, established new settlements (notably
Ibadan, Ijaye and new Oyo) each of which then set
out on a bid to inherit the mantle of the deceased Oyo
empire. Eventually, Ibadan emerged through bloody
rivalry to become the most successful of these new
states and to carve out an empire for itself covering a
large part of Yorubaland.1

All these developments affected different parts of the
country in different ways. For Ife—the ancient kingdom
reverted among the Yoruba as the original home of the
human race and the fountain-head of all the Yoruba
kingdoms—the nineteenth century was, in its total
effects, a very sad century. It was a century which saw
the subordination of Ife to one of the new states,
repeated destructions of the ancient town of Ile-Ife,
its repeated and prolonged degeneration into empty
jungle while its citizens fled to the villages and farms on

enforced exile, the despoiling of its wealth of art
treasures. By the time the town was finally resettled
towards the end of the century, there had, all told,
been no Ie-Ife for nearly twenty years.

Yet, for Ife, the first half of the century was one of
considerable hope and promise. About 1821, Owu,
which had begn traditionally a troublesome neighbour,
sacked Apomu, the Ife market town where, in the
preceding centuries, traders from distant parts of
Yorubaland had come to exchange their goods for the
imported goods brought up from the coast by the
Tjebu. This led to the Owu War in which an alliance of
Ife and Hebu fought Owu for about seven years.?
In this war, large numbers of the Oyo who were fleeing
from their flaming homes in the north, joined the Ife
and Ijebu against Owu.When the war came to an end
about 1827, Owu was in ruins, its people scattered in all
directions—most of them into the neighbouring Egba
towns and. villages.

The Owu War, then, led to the destruction of a neigh-
bour who, for centuries, had been a thorn in Ife’s
side. But that was not all. The victorious Ife-Ijebu allied
forces and their Oyo friends then turned all their might
on the Egba towns, many of which had supported Owu
in the late war. The Egba were dislodged from. their
towns and forced to flee, mostly southwards where,
under the protection of the Olumo Rock, they ultima-
tely founded the town of Abcokuta. In the end, the
allied troops, under the leadership of the Ife general,
Chief Okunade, the Maye, encamped on the site of
the Egba village called Ibadan and began to convert it
into a regular town.

All this immeasurably boosted the morale of the Ife
at home. As they saw it, the founding of Ibadan repre-
sented an expansion of their kingdom. The great Maye

regulate the use of their land in any way other than that
dictated by their needs and available funds. For instance,
the Palm Grove Estate was developed by a private.
businessman as a low density high value residential
district. In consequence of this, the Planning Authority
thought it wise to zone the area south and north of the
Estate into alow density district. But some landowners
insisted on building to a higher density because they
have not the funds to put up the type of building
required. In, other cases, members of the families sold
the same plots to different people resulting in numerous
litigations in courts.

The problem of landownership is being solved by
compulsory acquisition of land by the Planning Author-
ities who in turn sell it in plots to prospective land-
owners or industrial promoters.

Lack of Effective Control by Planning Authorities

An effective planning authority depends on (1) how
much power is invested in the authority; (2) the accept-
ability of the planning regulations; (3) the efficiency and
reliability of the building inspectors; and (4) in the case

‘of Nigeria the co-operation of the politicians and the
courts.

At the time when the Ikeja Area Planning Authority
(Ikeja A.P.A.) was inaugurated, there were two other
bodies—the Ministry of Lands and the Western Nigeria
Housing Corporation—charged with planning func-
tions. There was lack of co-ordination among these
bodies—to the detriment of effective planning in the
region.

As for the Ikeja Area Planning Authority, it decided
not to tamper with the existing land-use set up and to
accept responsibility for planning and controlling land-
use in the newly developing and the undeveloped areas,
So, large areas in Mushin, Itire, Oshodi, Shomolu remain
unplanned and a confused mass of buildings.

Even then, in the areas supposedly open to land-use
control, there is a wide gap between paper regulations
and field practices. For example, section 3, paragraphs 1
to 3-of the Ikeja Area Planning Authority building
regulations requires that building drawings and site
plans be submitted and approved before properties
can be developed. But the Chief Executive confirmed

on interview that over 60 per cent of the buildings in

44

Lawanson, Ajeromi and Shomolu are without app rove
plans. According to the Chief, there are four reasons
why his Authority has been incapable of exerting greater
control: (1) the people involved in the building con-
traventions were mostly politicians, some of whom
were his bosses in the council; (2) in the absence of a
lawyer on the staff, the Authority feels ill-equipped
to prosecute cases in courts; +(3) the Planning Authority
was relunctant to be involved in litigations because
cases which appeared as obvious irregularities were
usually turned down in the courts; (4) many of the
building inspectors are corrupt and do approve the
continuation, of buildings that are known to Hout
the regulations.

Absence of Genuine Measures of Administrative
and Physical Development

Since the creation of the Lagos State, different
measures directed towards the revamping of the
physical set-up of the fringe areas are being contem~
plated. But the government’s policy appears. to lack a
sense of direction and the measures so far taken do not
appear to derive from genuine efforts to improve but
are rather motivated by outward show of political
power—possibly to impress the Western State that the
new state is in effective control. For instance, on paper
the Lagos Executive Development Board and the Ikeja
Area Planning Authority have been merged, but in
actual fact they still operate within their old jurisdictions
and under the old executive leaderships.

Similarly, the city health and sanitary measures are
to be extended to the fringe area, the refuse collection
contractors are also to expand their service area to
include the suburbs; but in practice the collection of
refuse is so irregular and infrequent that no noticeable
impact has been made on the sanitary face of the fringe

region. In the field of metropolitan transportation,

the same political facade has been exhibited. Although
there is an acute shortage of buses in the city, buses go
out to Ikeja, Ojo, and Ikorodu every four hours,
where they have competed most unsuccessfully with
the “kiakia” group of mini-buses.

joys with other members of the family, for at time of
_ crisis it is they to whom one turns for help. Thus, this
sharing of the bride-wealth ensures that its refund will
be contributed to by both the father and mother’s
families should it become necessary later to return it
either because of divorce or some other reason, such
as when a wife decides to leave the husband’s family
after the death of her husband.”

We moved from the sitting-room into the dining-
room,

“This is very interesting and educating,”
Mrs Thompson.

“What about the polygamy aspect of the African
society?” asked Mr Richards,

“As we have noted all along this evening, polygamy
is a type of marriage in which a man has more than one
wife at the same time. The husband is sexually free
and can enter into more marriages if he wants and if

remarked

he has the financial means. Polygamy, which is strongly |

- encouraged, is the result. We now have the added
relationships of co-wives and half-brothers and half-
sisters. These added relationships differentiate polygamy
from monogamy.

“Polygamy has its advantages: as well as its disadvan-
tages. Because it is strongly encouraged in the African

society—by both men and women—it is greatly presti-
gious. Thus, it offers the husband security and position.
Polygamy also offers a man the suré road to children,
particularly when we bear in mind that many Africans
attach a stigma to barrenness. The African loves children
and married couples look up to having their very own
children, particularly as adoption of children is not
practised by the African. Thus, to an African man,
polygamy is a sure road to children since the chances of
all the wives being barren are reduced. In some African
societies, marriage is not complete until a wife becomes
pregnant and thus an indication of her fertility.

“Children are nursed by their mothers much longer
than is usual in western countries. Until weaning occurs
at the age“of two or later, the mother is expected to
abstain from sexual intercourse. Pregnancy during this
period is frowned upon; consequently, children are
spaced at least about three years. Among a people
where aftificial birth control means are almost non-exis-
tent, abstinence is the only means to avoid pregnancy.
However, the opportunity for a wife to shun or avoid
her husband’s advances for such a long period of time
is usually reduced in monogamy. Further, the number
of men who can endure such a long period of ‘dormancy
is small.”

A big roar of laughter.

table with two glasses of whisky.
He quickly stood up and went to the far-side of the

room where the light was dim. He took a seat and saw

Kwame coming towards him.

“I am sorry to be late,” Kwame said and took his own
seat. A waiter shuffled to their table and took orders.
“She is here! Didn’t I tell you?” Joseph told Kwame.
“Yes, I know. I saw her when I was coming in, I will
make this her last spying activity.”

The waiter came back with a bottle of whisky in an
ice bucket and two clean glasses. He handed the ice-
pick to Kwame and went away.

After serving each other’s drinks Joseph and Kwame

raised their glasses, grinned at each other and drank.

Joseph downed his drink in a gulp. He quickly poured
himself another and took a sip, then he set down his
glass which was half-filled. “Joe, I understand that a
consignment of diamond is arriving with your plane at
the end of the week.” “What!” Joseph asked his eyes.
bulging.

“Wait, what’s wrong with you? You want big money
don’t you?” Kwame poured more drink into Joseph’s

glass.

“Not that kind of money please.” Joseph replied curtly
though his heart was beginning to beat violently. If one
could lay hands on those stones! His wife was in
hospital with appendicitis, Jide’s examination is drawing
near, Bisi—his “friend” is demanding a gold watch, the
car salesman was only this morning telling him that the

car is still being held down for him. All are going to cost_

money. Money! money! money!

His hand wandered again to the drink and he took a
large gulp. Kwame who was watching him intently
knew that he was going to pin him.

“Alright, let’s have it. What’s the plan.” Joseph said
with carefreeness. Apparently, he was getting slightly
drunk,

“There is £5,000 in it for us if handled right.” Kwame
began.

“Yes, I've heard of that, go on.” Joseph was beginning
to get impatient..The juke-box was crooning out a

eee 8 .
Anita and her friend were still casting casual glances at
them, More people were beginning to pour in and the
waiters were busy. All these contributed to what
spurred Joseph to being more reckless.

“That consignment of diamond. could be ours if you
would be willing to co-operate, All you need do, is to
show me the manager’s office and you are £2,500
rich.” 4

Joseph looked around to see if anyone was listening.
When he saw that there was no one listening, he
replied:

“Tf it’s as easy as that, the whole world would be rich.”
He knew he was fascinated that this giant could take
the affair so easily. Probably because he was drunk, he
continued to listen. “You show me your manager’s
office and. wait for my own part of the deal to be
fulfilled,” Kwame said. He sipped his drink and watched
Joseph.

“Alright,” Joseph said “if you are sure your plan is not
going to exploge in your face, come tomorrow and I'll
take you down.” “That’s better. Good old Joe! I trust
you to co-operate.” Joseph was about to reach for his
glass again when he noticed that Anita and her friend
were departing. Anita looked back and their eyes met.
Then she was gone.

At Anita’s place, Taiwo—a corporal in the city
Police listened with intent to Anita’s account of what she
heard. in the office that afternoon. 3
“They have met now and only God knows what they
are planning,” Anita concluded. “Might be an attempt
at grabbing the diamond that is coming to your place,”
Tatwo put in.

“No, I trust Mr Adio,” Anita said.

“Well, I will report this to my sergeant and present you
as a witness. Can you come to the station tomorrow?”
Taiwo asked drawing Anita unto his lap.

“Alright dear, P'll come during break,” Anita replied.
She curled up on Taiwo’s lap and kissed him. Taiwo
reached for the bed-switch and the light went out.

The following day, Anita did not go into the inner
office. When Joseph went out to ask her something she
was very curt and she refused to meet his face.

John Kwame came in at break period and luckily,
Anita was out, Joseph took Kwame to the manager’s
office and introduced him to Henry Adeoye—executive
Managing Director for Eagle Airways.

The manager took a slight dislike to Kwame and
could have dismissed them both with an excuse if not

BOOK REVIEW

THE ROYAL NAVY AND THE SLAVERS

By

W. E. F. Warp -
- (George Allan and Unwin—gos.)

UCH hitherto unpublished material extra-

cted from the London Public Records

Office is included in this new book on the Victorian
Navy's part in the suppression of the Atlantic Slave
_ Trade. Mr Ward slings his narrative, hammock-like,
between two’ pegs: the British Parliament’s Abolition
Debate of 1807 and the 1863 American proclamation
abolishing the status of slavery for persons ‘heldasslaves’

in the States in rebellion. Mr Ward has a good story _

to tell and uses reports of the naval officers of the West
African Squadron to single out the various factors he
thinks important. It was interesting to learn that it was
only after the conclusion of the American Civil War
that Andrew Jackson got the 13th Amendment through
Congress and abolished slavery in the Federal States
of Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland and Delaware.

The intricacies of legal argument in the Courts of
Mixed Commission at Freetown are presented to illu-
strate the dangers for over-zealous aval officers falling
foul of the interests of the ship owners. Other chapters
deal similarly with what became known as the ‘equip-
ment clause.’ Under this provision Britain’s sailors
could secure the condemnation of vessels equipped
with slave chains, racks, extra water casks and feeding
facilities for human cargoes.

A great merit of the book is that it draws attention
to’ the Angola/Brazil trade. Below the line the anti-
slavery squadrons were initially forbidden to arrest
slaving vessels as they were also forbidden to touch
vessels loading in Portuguese ports. Portugal had, of
course, been Britain’s ally against Napoleon. Historians
can do with more information about the ‘high-handed
Admiral Reynolds’ and his operations in the Brazils.

Many flashes of humour seep through the notes.
One likes, instinctively, the Chief of Ambriz, who
refused a Naval subsidy offered to induce him to sign a
treaty but courteously sent a gift of two pigs to the
gun-boaters—‘for your dinner!’

Half plate illustrations in the book are carefully
selected from ship actions between individual sloops
and slavers; other line drawings illustrate the rigs used
by the slavers and a glossary of nautical terms is included.
I found the cross headings, present in some chapters,
absent in others, irritating, but this is a matter of taste.

Mr Ward confesses himself a landsman, and includes
in the glossary explanations of naval terms used at the
time.

A major criticism of this work is that it is a remark-
ably English book; heroes are naval officers, villains are
Cuban, Americans and ‘Dago slavers.’ Information

2kxuoZMBZK9IE8y6iHj-,"about the later is still sparse despite the title of the
work, which one finds curiously similar to that of
Christopher Lloyd’s original classic ‘The Navy and the
Slave Trade.’

Wemust be indebtedto Mr Ward’s careful researches
which have drawn attention to further problems for
historians and to the publisher for presenting these
selections in a character of publication which has the
smack of contemporaneity in type face and arrangement.

Why were the African exporters prepared to continue
with the trade: In what currency were they paid?
And what happened to the cargoes re-landed after
capture: These questions are perhaps outside Mr

Me

Ward’s theme, but a work under this title should deal
equally with the Slavers. We must look to some future
African historian to illumine these problems. A great
deal more is needed about the motives and characters
of exporters and importers.

In the meantime we are grateful to Mr Ward for
unearthing the few clues to this line of research, and
pethaps the Liverpool shipping companies’ records
and early Lagos archives rather than merely British
Government documents should be examined. Romance
is not infrequently found in a Bill of Lading. _

POEMS

FAREWELL TO MY KINGDOM

A KING’S LAMENTATION

Of once renowned ruling ancestors born
So early forestoled great race of Glory to run ~
Late to me revealed by that aging sage
Soon born, soon by uncles engage
‘But enviable crown of Kingship was in latter years to

wear

Still toilsome now in this crowning year

So from hand to hand this Kingship craft to learn
Though young in years, but wisdom with pains to earn
No sooner sit on ancient throne to reign

Soon more warriors ancient cities gain

But now captive at my kingdom’s gate

So dictates the hands of contesting fate

Now forest to forest the royal household ride
By once trusted elders, of late soon misguide.

Me who once by many foreigners homage pay

 

Now like beggar calmly crave on that dreadful way.

PRESCRIPTION

The fire which sizzled the haze of myth, burns the
legend —
Burns the prided“palm: which taps the wine of
tradition
The enemy of our history.

The fire which carpeted this land, on the leasing of her
freehold
Destroys the nursing womb: which breeds her
young
A land faded from the past.

The bullet which shattered the range of her long history
Triggers the unholy noise: which tries her prop of
wisdom ‘
She clowns fouling her gratitude.

And the airs of hope frequent hang on to the tinkle
Call calms and breaks, and her-appetites remember
Once she fed on sour palm.

The palm which is the emblem is gentle and kinder,
not the kernels
Fierce and tense: and hopes become a burden
By the wine you taste in the pub.

ALL LENGTH IS TORTURE

I began without seeking to find
Ease comfort and worldly pleasures
But when they come by measures
I began to revel with an easy mind
In what greed and avarice unbind
To let loose what my yearnings bred.
I had hoped in vain to tread
A true path and mind the slope
But vanity and worldliness flanged my scope
And I knew not where I was led;
____ Every step led me to a giddy height
~~ With every fellow traveller a foe
_ As my yearnings sowed their plight—
I never thought the fare would be so:
Ihave learnt my woes to disclose
And only death will give me repose.

these areas’ were cleaicd al-Kanemi punished the
tribes who had helped the Fulani invaders and,
when the campaigning was over, he rewarded his
Kanembu and other followers with slaves captured
in the wars.

The Bagirmi, too, had not been idle since the
death of Dunoma. They had continued raiding
along the eastern frontiers and a permanent
army had had to be maintained in the area to keep
them out. The raids went on until 1824 and

during the course of the fighting al-Kanemi’s
eldest son was killed, although Bornu is credited
with capturing 30,000 slaves.

By the time the Fulani areas had all been lib-
erated and the Bagirmi menace subsided al-
Kanemi felt himself strong enough to attack the
Fulani controlled emirates outside Bornu. He
still saw these states as a threat and believed that
they would never leave Bornu alone. For some
time he had prepared the way by contacting the
deposed Habe or non-Fulani chiefs of the areas
between Bornu and Kano. By this means Dan
Kauwa of Katagum, the nephew of Mallam Zaki,
was overthrown and also Hama Wabi of Jemavari:
these were all emirates which had been created
under the Fulani but-many of the subjects were
bitterly opposed to them. In Katagum, Azangu
was installed as the chief of the Shirawa, living
south of present day Azare.

In 1824 al-Kanemi’s column set out from Kuka
with Kano and the restoration of. the Hausa
sarki as the ultimate goal. The column numbered
about 50,000 of which approximately 30,000 were
cavalry: the remainder were made up of Kanembu
infantry and camp followers. The first obstacle
was near at home when the Bedde resisted the
passage of the Bornu troops furiously. Gorgoram
was founded by them as a rallying point but al-
Kanemi fought his way past them and traversed
Katagum to Hadejia where the emir was defeated.
He began his final advance on Kano.

Sultan Bello in Sokoto had been most alarmed
on hearing of the advance and had sent his Waziri
Gidado to command a relief column. The Waziri
had summoned the formidable Yakubu, the
founder of the Bauchi emirate, with his forces and
the two armies met at Fake in Garko district,
seventy miles east of Kano, in 1826.

A very fierce battle ensued and for some time it
seemed that the Bornu forces would prevail,
particularly when Madaki Hassan, Yakubu’s
senior commander, was killed. But the Fulani
bowmen saved the day. When the battle was
at its thickest, covered in a pall of dust so that the
participants could scarcely distinguish each other,
the bowmen commenced a murderous fire in the
direction of the tightly packed Bornu cavalry

Nopa told his brother Petu that the aréa
occupied by them was still too small. ‘Three days
later Lukere was asked to consult the Ifa Oracle
which pronounced that they should travel some
few miles forward until they arrived at a place
now called Odore. On arrival Petu and his people
settled on another towards the left leaving a very
narrow clear gap between them. These bushes
had never been tampered with till today. Here
they stayed for a long period. Lukere travelled few
yards and got a separate thick jungle. He cleared a
part in the centre and made a house there. From
there he sent messages to Petu his master.

After sometime, Nopa decided to leave and tra-
velled further north of Ishiwo where he gave his
brother a goat. Since then whenever a new Nopa

_ Was appointed at Ijebu-Imushin a goat must
be sent to Petu before the Nopa was recognized
by Petu. Nopa went to settle as far as Imushin,
a town approximately seven miles to Ishiwo.

Lukere told Petu to move very near him. At the
road junction just some ten yards to the entrance
of Lukere residential jungle Petu branched to a

‘ jungle inhabited by baboons, monkeys and apes.

""Here Petu settled. The name of this town (capital)
‘Imowe (where monkeys feed.and drink) is derived

*

from the inhabitants of the place. The first Oba of
Ishiwo came from this place.

Lukere often visited his people in person but
owing to immoral behaviour of the people towards
him—they called him names and put curse on
him—he felt he should never be called to help.
He therefore decided to sink into the ground with
a chain tied to his waist. Part of this chain can still
be seen protruding from the ground in the jungle
where he sank.

Lukere thus became the immortal and invisible
god of Ishiwo. He is worshipped seasonally or
whenever non-indigenous priests come to worship.
These priests are appointed after having been
sanctioned by an Ifa Oracle or announced before
the death of a priest. The ceremony for sacrifice
to Lukere is greatly upheld by Ishiwo people.
During such ceremonies Ishiwo people, old and
young, go home in large numbers to offer prayer
and ask for his blessing and protection. People
do not come to spend their annual salary on the
day. Lukere as a social and life-guarding deity is
regarded as the only saviour of the people of
Ishiwo. The importance of the deity is also known

in Lagos and feared by the Lagosians of decades

ago. |

LAKU

By

S. ADELUGBA _

T was midnight and everybody in Isako village had
I slept. There couldnothave been any light anywhere
throughout the village at that time of the night. No
one ever slept with his clay-lamp burning. What if the
roof of palm-leaves and bamboo-sticks caught fire?
Or suppose any of the sleepers accidentally caused the
clay-lamp to fall from its stand? The risk of being hurt
by the hot palm-oil was even greater than that of being
- burnt by the glowing flame.

The moon was not shinning either. The new-moon
appeared only recently. Isako was therefore enveloped
in the thick darkness of midnight. It was a silent night.
Little babies might be crying in the privacy of their
mothers’ rooms, but the sound did not break the silence
outside. Even Alu, the madman who used to make a
lot of noise in the night was very quict that night.
Bats didn’t fly; and if they did they did not make their
chirping sounds.

There was perfect silence and thick darkness. Then
came a breach, Like a splash of palm-oil on a snow-
white garment.

WME, 6 te ns tc oh! Yah—yeh!”

The silent night was rendered confused by the loud
sonorous. voice that uttered this inscrutable sound.

“Mama — mama — mama,” little children cried and
nestled around mothers in terror and horror as they
woke up abruptly from their sleep.

“You see him, You see death.

You spy him, you spy death.

You meet him, you meet death.

Here he comes, the death of the living.
Here he comes, the life of the dying.
The one and only — ‘Lakulala’ !”

118

The conftsed men and women readjusted themselves
on their mats, relieved by these words.

“Oh, it’s “Lakulala,’ husband of the young lady and
the ageing woman. Husband of the tall and the short.
Husband of all that plait their hairs. Lakulala!” Said
Ojo as he rose up from his mat.

“Aina, where is. that he-goat? You know we pro-
mised Lakulala one he-goat three years ago when
Bolatan was childless.” ;

“Yes, Bolatan, Amoke, my good daughter; she’s now
amother of two! That’s right. But I wonder if that kid
has not wandered out of my reach. Let me see if it’s
in the kitchen.” :

“Lakulala, the one who sees all,

He who hides from the daylight or moonlight

Can never hide from the eyes of ‘Laku’.

Lakulala, the one who hears all.

If you have any secret

Don’t whisper it.

Lakulala hears everything.

La-ku-la-la-o !”
Lakulala’s followers raised their voices in turns to sing in
his praise. There was no idle talk or jest as men often
do when in company. The sound of Lakulala’s move-
ment was terrific. Each movement of his legs produced
the sound of ringing bells, barking dogs, clapping cala-
bashes and shells knocking one another.

“Let the dying arise

Lakulala says you won't die.

Let the living rejoice secretly

And keep within his walls.”
Lakulala raised his voice again and rent the air with
the high pitch of his voice:

takes and misdeeds. The one who promised. a pound and

are not dead, they have gone to play with their father.
Ah! O-ri-sha! 1 worship you. Ifa, I salute you. My
seniors, I bow down. I will never never offend you,
Baba.” He looked round and then turned fully to Ojo.

“Tfa says you should take a ram to the road junction at
midnight and slaughter it there. Let Bolatan kneel
down naked and appeal to ‘Orisa’, to forgive her.
You should also take another ram to Lakulala’s shrine.
Don’t slaughter that. It is on it that you will place
your left hand. Bolatan and her mother should knee
down with their palms stretched out to appease Lakulala
and make new promises. Ifa says after doing so there
isno more trouble. You will have another set of twins—
so says Ifa. But before we go, Ifa says you should hold
seven, sixpenmny-pieces on your right and seven six-
penny-pieces on your left. Put the money on your left
palm on the right side of this tray and the one on your
right palm to the left side of the tray. Then clap your
hands thrice and say—‘‘My hands are clean of all evil

curses.”
The headmaster did not sleep as he hoped to. Instead
he was smiling and this later developed into laughter.
He was laughing gently, and later it became loud.
So loud did he laugh that his wife woke up and hissed.
She went to him to warn him that other people were
sleeping and that Lakulala himself could not have gone
very far. She opened the door and found her husband
lying on the bare floor—laughing hysterically.

“Why don’t you do this on your bed if you are to
laugh as wildly as this:”

122

The headmaster did not seemi to hear her; he con-
tinued laughing. ;

“Get up and lie on your bed!”

Mr Adam was laughing even. more loudly now and
struggling ineffectually to get up. His wife tried to lift
him, but his limbs were stiff.

She tried to carry him, it was not easy. “Yee-e-ch!
My neighbours, come and save me. My husband is in
trouble!” Mrs Adam cried at the top of her voice.
She could not go beyond her gate as she imagined
Lakulala might be near-by. Nobody came out in res-
ponse to her call as it was too late in the night and more-
over, no one could dare take the risk of coming into the
street for fear of Lakulala.

“Yee-egch! E gba mi o!” She ran back to help her
husband and ran to the gate again to shout for help.
Nobody came to her aid arid Mr Adam was laughing
away his life. Mrs Adam sat by his side, helpless.
Weeping and hissing. Grumbling and clapping.

“Ah! my husband. You treat me this way! The
squirrel says, ‘If one reprimands his child the child
should hearken’, Imagine the young squirrel’s head in
the dinner-plate!” :

That is it. I warned you of the dangers of despising
everything indigenous and upholding only the things
you read from books and heard in college. 1 warned
you against the mystery surrounding Lakulala. Every-
body fears that spirit. Nobody ever tries to ask questions
about him — except you! You asked questions — this
is the answer! Oh!....”

The headmaster made a deep sigh. All his limbs
straightened and stiffened, His eyes wide open without
twinkling. His face grim and cold.

the kid.

Ojo waited in vain to hear his he-goat struggle with

Lakulala’s followers. After sometime, the kid bleated.

They were barking, and kicking; jumping and tearing.
The front-window of the headmaster’s house was
partially opened. The darkness hid any sign of human
presence behind the window. Lakulala stood still.
There was another yell from one of his followers:
“The snake ishungry
The tortoise rejoices,

The tortoise and the snake?

Both food for man. |

Lakulala did not move. He stood still.

“Three periods make a day.

The night-wizard ne’er flies by day.

Neither does the day-wizard by night.

Lakulala— o!” Another follower yelled.
~ Lakulala dipped his hand into his bag and brought
out a small gourd. He poured some of its contents on
his palm and blew it towards the headmaster’s house.
As he moved towards the house the window closed
gently. The.dogs barked and the bells rang, The cala-
bashes clapped and the shells clanked. Lakulala drew
something in front of the headmaster’s house with his
big toe. He cried on top of his voice:

“Oh —o........ oh! Yah — yeh!”

That day his life melted.

The day fire despised water

That day his life washed away.

Then he whispered for about a minute, spat on the
ground and mattered some words. Lakulala did not go
further. From there he returned home without saying
a word, The dogs barked repeatedly and wildly.
Lakulala’s followers cursed and hissed. The bells rang
unmusically and disturbingly, drowning the sounds
of the calabashes and shells.

“Lakulala has returned home so quickly! He has

it until the next three years. 1 wonder why he rejected
it. “Ojo said to his half-awakened wife. -

In the study of Yoruba traditional religion,
Some -words are already “foreign words” to
Monolingual native speakers of the language.
These words have therefore attracted the in-
Senuity of folk imagination. Thus we read that
irinmalé means “four hundred divinities”, that
Orisa is dri sé “the source of being” or o ri sa?
“Did you find to pick?”; that Olédimaré means
Olédi: omo aré “Oléda, son of a boa constrictor”
Or Olédi, md ré, “Olédi don’t go”! It seems
€verything and anything goes: what James Barr
Calls “the production of multiple meanings”?

Folk theology cannotavoid popularetymology.
The theology of the “Yahwist”, the author of
the oldest tradition in the Pentateuch, is very

— Much built on popular etymology—that Eve
_ Was so named because she was the mother of
all life; that Isaac was so named because his
Mother Jaughed when an angel foretold the birth
Of the child; that Jacob was so named because
he grabbed his twin brother by the heel while
they were still in the womb; that Cain was so
‘Ramed because his mother said at his birth:

Thave acquired a man with the help of God”;
that Abraham was so named because God said
that he would become the father of a multitude;

t Moses was so named because Pharaoh’s
daughter drew the baby found in the bulrushes

Theologian.”® He was not bothered by the fact
that there were alternative folk etymologies,
like the record that Cain (Tubal-Cain) was the
first to make implements of iron, or that it was
Isaac’s father who laughed and not his mother,
or that Beersheba was so named because of a
vow made there. Folk theology does not stop
to consider these details. But the inconsistencies
are discovered by later readers who have to
grapple with the interpretation of Scripture.
Some get so frustrated with the naive science
and the naive etymologies that they cease to
read such “childish stuff” entirely.

But others set about to exegete the scriptures,
to sift the kerygma from the mythological para-
phernalia, to get to the root of the matter. Thus
Biblical scholars have sharpened their linguistic
and philological equipments and now read the
Bible armed with the methods of literary criti-
cism, form criticism and source criticism. They
no longer take things for granted.

The same process is beginning in the study
of traditional Yoruba culture. Questions are
being raised about the traditional explanations
given to various key words. If badlé is truly
iba ilé “father of the house”, why do we have
badlé ilé? Does it mean “father of the house”?
If irtinmalé is, as is often said, irin(wd) imal
“four hundred daemons,’ how can we have
Otalénirinwé irtinmalé? Does it mean “four
hundred and sixty 400 daemons”? How do we
account for the -k- in ¢hinkalé “back of the
house”, the -l- in balawé@ “bath room”, the -m-
in ojojlimd “every day”, or the -m- in dmigd
“foolish person” ? Is there any i/2 “ground” in 6
selé “It happened’’? Is there any noun in kdld/d
“to stammer”, téle “to follow”, padé “to meet”,
kérira “to hate”? Is parg “to be rubbed off”
analysable into two verbs “pa?” and ré “?""?
These are some of “ the multitude of difficulties
and obscurities which have provoked the
recourse to philological treatment.”*

On bended knees, hands outstretched
For their daily bread.

Let the crumps fall;

So that the Kingdom of God may come
On, earth to mect them all alive.

Let the crumps fall, even crumps, ™
Though God’s children may prefer
Fresh “manna” from heaven,

To crumps from Ance’s table.

When the Almighty
Sent his Son to die for our sins
There was hunger on earth;
His son suffered it, like the rest
But crumps did not fall,
Rather he died.
Not from wounds

~ Inflicted on his hands and legs,
Nor from heart-break—
Because he was tortured:
How long could he hold out from
Thirst, hunger, and exposed confinement
On the solitary Cross? He died
To assuage our spiritual hunger.
His immortal soul was sacrificed
For our soul's lust for immortality
And our bodies remains unfed.,

And today, seething revolutions rage

Because millions of God’s children,

Have stones instead of bread;

Let the crumps fall

So that many more of God’s children

May not die for nothing.

The Shehu’s forces now relied to a considerable
extent, as did all the armies of those days, upon
their heavy cavalry which could sweep across the
open countryside of Hausaland unchecked. Both
the horses and riders were protected by quilted
armour and chain mail and the riders wielded
swords or spears. But the Fulani had learned in

their early days, before they had horses, how to

use foot-soldiers armed with bows or spears with
great effect. Indeed, it was with these that they
had, to the surprise of all but themselves, beaten
the Gobir cavalry at Tabkin Kwotto. Now that
they had the horsemen they did not dispense
with the foot-soldiers but-used.them in projecting
great showers of arrows and spears as a prelim-

horsemen when they were hard pressed. On more
than one occasion, when the tide of battle seemed
to be turning against them, the bowmen saved the
day by firing great concentrations of arrows
into the main body of the enemy.

directed their forces against Kebbi and the
disorderly elements in Zamfara they were under
no illusions of the threat that the Gobirawa
presented. In other words, the jihad could not
be counted as successful until the Gobirawa under
Yunfa had been finally defeated. But the generals
did not make the mistake of underestimating the
power of Gobir. They preferred to consolidate
their rear and flanks before committing them-
selves to an all out attack.

Thus the defeat of Kebbi and Zamfara gave.

them safe bases from which to operate, a sanctuary
which was to develop into the Sokoto heartland,
so that at the beginning of 1806 Namoda with his
column was able to range about along the eastern

. fringes where Gobir bordered on Katsina. He

met the Air Tuareg, Yunfa’s allies, on the Rafin
Tafara near Zurmi. They attacked him but he
defeated them so soundly that they sued for peace
with the Muslims and no longer presented
any menace. By this Yunfa lost the only allies
left to him. He had appealed for help to the other
Hausa states and compared the Shehu’s jihad to a
small fire which he had allowed to burn and which
now threatened to engulf him. But the other
Hausa chiefs were unable to help. They were all
fully occupied by their own problems, which
consisted of attacks, or revolts, by the Fulani
clanheads and others to whom the Shehu had
given flags. a
Following Namoda’s success against the Tuareg
an expedition was sent out against Alkalawa after
the 1806 rains under Aliyu Jedo. They first of all
desolated the surrounding countryside and des-
troyed all the crops which were standing ready for
harvesting on their arrival, They established a
war camp under the walls «and from there
attempted, still without success, to storm the city.
By the establishment of this camp, however, and
the destruction of the crops, the city was virtually
besieged. The outlying populations either came
into the city or fled to other distant Gobir towns,
no doubt spreading despondency as they went.

Kukawa is now a small sleepy village, headquarters of the Kanembu District of Bornu Emirate, and Right

in al-Kanemi’s time the Bornu army was equipped with some muskets of this kind

ranks. This fire was so effective that the Bornu
soldiers had to disengage and in the ensuing
confusion they lost much of their baggage as well
as their drums.

Al-Kanemi decided not to continue with his
advance on Kano. The column had done extremely
well to reach this far but it was already deep in
country infested with enemy and even if he took
Kano it would have been of little use if his routes
back to Bornu had been closed by the fluid,
mobile forces of the Fulani. Sultan Bello always
considered al-Kanemi a redoubtable opponent
after this advance and if it achieved nothing else
it kept the Fulani away from Bornu in the future.

Although much of al-Kanemi’s life in Bornu
was occupied in fighting either the Bagirmi or the
Fulani the power and authority which this gave
him never changed his scholarly demeanour.
He was never a warrior king and never pretended
to be one but his early life had given him a sound
judgment and an agility of mind far in advance
of any other person in the Chad basin. He used
his abilities to save Bornu and to strive against
what he considered to be the Fulani menace to
the Chad basin: in fact he saved the basin from
being overrun. But he was not a man who delighted
in war for its own sake and he detested the blood-
shed and cruelty which followed, in its train.

When the explorer Clapperton visited him he was
very keen to have a supply of the rockets which
were demonstrated to him. His reason was that
they would be fired over enemy towns and forces
to cause them to surrender without bloodshed.

In between the fighting al-Kanemi made
strenuous efforts to bring enlightenment to
Bornu, both spiritually and in the day to day
administration of the land. For this he depended
heavily on the Arabs who had followed him to
Bornu and such was his control that they admin-
istered under him with effeciency and honesty.
Whenever possible al-Kanemi would put over his
ideas without force and such was his goodness that
people accepted them in good faith because of the
man himself. His own life was exemplary and no
critic has ever raised his voice against his own
personal conduct or standards,

Apart from administration and unavoidable
wars al-Kanemi realized that trade was necessary
to Bornu. Profiting from the example of Kano he
encouraged merchants from North Africa, in
particular Tripoli, to settle in Kuka and these
formed the beginning of a colony of Tripolitanian
and Fezzanese merchants who have remained in
Bornu ever since. Al-Kanemi’s idea was to intro-
duce the trade of the Mediterranean direct to
Bornu via the Garamantian Road, dispensing with

of a dance performed during waking ceremonies.
No one could however say when the dance was
first introduced.

The corps of drums consists of xylophone
beaten by a wooden cleat ““Y” shaped, two small
drums, algeita (which has now replaced corn
stalk flutes) and a drum (which has replaced
Gundari another type of drum made from a
leather diaphragm which covers the top of an
earthenware pot).

It is only in recent years that Bonsuwai is now

generally accepted as the dance for happy
occasions. The style has undergone so many
changes that only the initiated can cope with the
formations, “

In Biu, for instance, the xylophonist plays solo
to a group of girls in a kneeling posture and
dancing to the beat of xylophone music by
demonstrating stances for household chores like
grinding, pounding yam, etc. Such poetic postures
and demonstrations by the girls always invite a
shower of gifts in the form of money from their
admirers.

Within sixty minutes of setting out, Lakulala had not
covered a four-forty yards distance, but his gifts have
_ grown large. He-goats, rams, cocks, and coins, as each
. Person had promised three years ago when Lakulala
_ promised them various fortunes. The barren woman
with a baby or two, the sick one now bouncing in good
health, the penniless who now owns pounds, shillings
and pence, the fathers and mothers whose ‘lost’ children
are home with them after many years of absence from
home. Lakulala certainly had reasons to be surrounded
with such majesty and loaded with so much gifts.
“Aina, Lakulala will soon pass in front of this house;
Bring the he-goat and I will tie it to that stump outside
myself.” Said Ojo to his wife in full awareness of the
haste necessary in getting the gift-kid ready before the
passing of Lakulala. Aina squinted through the darkness
for the he-goat in the kitchen. There could be nothing
More confusing and difficult to look for in such a thick
darkness as a black he-goat as this.

“Aina, can’t you find it?” Ojo whispered through
the back-yard window. “You had better be quick.”
“A black kid hiding in this thick darkness? It is not

®asy to find,” Aina replied.

_ Aina carried the he-goat in both arms, and handed
it Over to Ojo. The dogs barked, the bells rang. Laku-
lala moved forwards. One of his followers raised his
Voice in eulogy.

“The barren becomes a mother

The impotent husband a father.

The vagabond of yesterday

Now owns acres of yam-farm.

3 Lakulala is here, all hail !”

Do you know that all this ‘Lakulala’ business does
HOt impress me in the least? Mr Adam bellowed to his
Wife. “You see, when wewere in the Training College,
We used to put up a lot of masquerading shows to mark

€ end of term and collect some money. All these

_ 88 are play-things with students. I wonder why
, . Whole ‘village dreads everything about this Laku-

‘Ah, I think this one is more than mere schoolboy
Masquerading. I think there is some mystery about the

“Verything is shrouded in mystery.” The wife replied.

Let me tell you. [ have worked in various stations

similar experiences in my stations and on closer inves-
tigation I found out that most of these things were

his wife.

“The wisdom of today.

Is the folly of tomorrow.

The dying may live

The living may die.

The word of your mouth

Must come to pass: Lakulala 0!” ‘
Another follower of Lakulala took his turn and Lakulala
himself raised his voice into the air in response :

Ss ec ee: oh! Yah —yeh!”

Whatever doubts might have escaped into Mrs

Adam’s mind through her husband’s comments on
Lakulala got abated by the events of the following
minute and all she could do was to walk in unsteady
steps back to her own room. She tried to close her eyes
but could not sleep. She rolled from one end of the bed

their area.
“Who says there is no spirit?
Who says there is no power?
Who says there is no man?
Who says he is there?
Where Lakulala is? :
Who despises you? Lakulala—o!” |

The headmaster giggled in his room. This filled his
wife with fear and rage. She dashed out of her room
and descended on her husband furiously whispering —
angry words and warning him to be quiet.

“T am surprised that in spite of your education and
christian upbringing you still believe in this fictitious
money-raking business of Lakulala and his followers.”
The headmaster spoke to his wife amidst smiles. and
“You'd better talk less loudly. The people are

very neat.” |

“T am not afraid, even if you are:” He replied.

“Tt is better to be afraid and live than to die in
stupid bravado.” ;

“Don’t talk to me; go to bed!”

“f tell you, be quiet.” Mrs Adam warned her
husband and tip-toed back to her room.

The bells rang and the dogs barked. The calabashes
clapped and the snail-shells clanked. —

Then there was dead silence.

““WACELET”

AMANA was uneasy. Usually torpid under the
gneiss Hills of Rokaga, the railway brought
occasional strangers, but they were normally mostly in
transit to Soja, the copper mining centre on The
. Plateau. Those who detrained were an odd assemblage
of Government officials, touring politicians, pick-
pockets, and “ladies of no fixed abode.” The railway
police knew most of them well.

‘Sergeant Salawu, the new detachment commander,
was sweating on his promotion, and every button on
his tunic was a joy to behold. Jenkinson was due to
report in six months time. The twenty constables had
long ago resigned themselves to six months of “Keen-
ness”; sweating too they had gradually begun to enjoy
their drill.

In the District Office, Jenkinson looked at the
Circular from the Commissioner.

“How the hell do they expect me to stage appro-
priate jubilation?” he thought,

“Government Funds may be debited to Head 1395
Subhead 11/79, but normal Audit Rules will apply.”

Shrugging he looked out of the window and caught
a glimpse of the hills shrouded in the soft grey light
of a clear day in September.

Up the red, damp laterite track which ran through
the new layout, a wobbling motor-bicycle, two pillion
passengers aboard, slithered to a halt. It was the Town
Clerk, and two unidentified “brothers” of the Town
Clerk, No doubt in search of a job, thought Jenkinson
wryly.

“Hello, Sir,” Sunny Eruka was unfailingly cheerful,
“Can I introduce Felix and Constantine?” 3

“Hello, Sunny,” grinned Jenkinson, “more ‘town
brothers’ looking for lucrative emloyment?”

It was an old game. Both Eruka and Jenkinson
enjoyed it.

“No, Sir, that damn fool Salawu! He’s drilled your
police so hard that no one wants to join them now.”

128

“Well, what is it then?” Jenkinson’s impatience was
habitual. “You'll have to hurry. P’'ve got the Council ©
in half an hour’s time. We’ve got to decide how you —
oppressed.gitizens are going to celebrate ‘your release
from imperialist bastards like me!”

“Isn’t it an odd thing?” Eruka was serious for a —
moment, “Some of you District Officers and imperialists |
aren't really bastards. But I could never get up on the
Debating Society floor and admit it!”

“Bet your bank balance isn’t half as oppressed as
mine,” retorted Jenkinson. “Any way what do Messrs
Felix and Constatine want?”

“Looking for a spot of business,” smiled Eruka
disarmingly. “We've got to have a GRAND ALL
NIGHT DANCE for Independence, and Felix has
got a friend who’s got a dance band in Soja.” He too —
regretted the gay timesin the big mining centre, above _
the hills. |
“Well, come and sce me after the meeting and don’t —

ask me for any money!” He knew very well that that —
was exactly what Eruka was after,

The shutters were drawn back, and the sun played ~
gently round the Council table. |
“But £50! Young Habib had the bit between his —
henna’ed teeth. “It’s absurd, it’s discrimination, its’ an
imperialist trick to divide and rule and I shall write
to the Premier about it...”
Habib was a national politician. He had just got his —
seat in the Chief’s council. He always brought the —
Premier into every possible discussion, even if it was —
sanitary collection and the demand by the Union of —
Night Soil Men for an extra 5s per week!
Isiah, the old Chief, turned gently to Jenkinson, —

t many ways Dele De Branco believed December
one thing it was his tenth month outside of school since
he began to read and write; and the fifth month on an
important job. Furthermore the preparations for his
second stage of life were reaching a critical pomt. His
family had been quite anxious about his engagement
to former Miss Stella Dada Abilodan; on their own
they had arranged for a number of rituals in readiness
for the important day. . |

Up in Mando his request for a maiden leave was
graciously granted. His superior officers were quite
sympathetic’ about the whole thing. They were not

prepared to mess up a good job well-started. But in™

spite of everyone’s co-operation he felt irritated about
the amount of time consumed in trying to locate the one
responsible for giving the fmal word about his marriage.
After tossing him around like a dice for sometime a
firm decision was taken.

Everything worked out perfectly well. All was set for
the family extravaganza.

Each passing hour became longer as December 8th
drew nearer. It was as if the speed of the revolution of
the earth had been somehow slowed down. The whole
world was working at snail’s speed as far as he was
concerned. But there was a brighter side to this gloomy
situation. Letters came to him from his fiancee in such a
rapid succession that he suspected that she had hired a
few hands to write them, and then chartered a plane to
send her couriers to him. She wrote in long-hand most
of the time, and when there was more to say, she typed.
For any young man that was not only a glorious period
but a rare moment in life when one could consider
himself content or at least gladdened by events.

On December 6th, Dele slept late. He got up at about
thirty-three minutes after six o'clock in the morning,

As he moved close to the wall to open the windows he

ekxToZMBZK9IE8y6nXhJ,"Popular etymology in Yoruba nearly hit on
correct etymological methods when Yoruba
folk, on hearing of an English man with the
name of Robert, jumped to the conclusion that
the man must be. fat. For the English word
Robert, pronounced (rabat), has the three con-
sonants r-b-t. These coincide with an abstract
consonantal root that in Yoruba morphology
signifies the general idea of roundness of form.
In the human shape this means robustness,
fatness:

roboto “round”
ribiti “round” (like the full moon)
rubutu

_ roboto/rokpoto “fat”
rabata/rakpata “‘large’’!

_ rebete/rekpete “‘extensive’”®
- Similar to this imputation of fatness to Robert
is the imputation of fattiness to Dan (Daniel):
boys with the name of Dan are teased by their
friends as Dddni oldrd;.‘‘Dan, full of fat’. Be-
cause of an association of the consonants d-n
in Dan.with the consonatal root in the Yoruba
. words ddin “oil” and din “to fry (in oil)”. There
is evidence, therefore, that Yoruba folk con-
sciousness sometimes seeks answers to etymol-
ogical problems through sound similarities
between utterances and that sometimes it even
ascribes meaning to the consonants in a word.3

What happens to words in a foreign language
happens to words which are “foreign’’ because
they belong to an older form of the language
which is now improperly understood, as the
English of Chaucer is a foreign language to all
but less than one per cent of the English speaking
peoples. Thus the old form Yoruba word omd-

spelt (p) in Yoruba orthography.

*Cf. Syriac yaributa “size’’.

* Dan (Daniel) is actually a name from the Old Testa-
ment. It is the Hebrew word for “‘to judge’’. It has a
true cognate in Yoruba. For d, the word has /> itun
“judicial administrative section of a town”. An itun
is presided over by an Oloritun the head of the
“itun”, a chief whose function is similar to that of an
honorary Justice of the Peace. The Arabic diin in
yaum al-diin “the day of judgement” is from the same
root. The phonological correspondence is similar to
that found between Hausa dama “right hand’ and
Yoruba otun “right hand”. For Daani olora, see d-n
in Arabit duhn ‘‘fat’’.

luwabi “good mannered person”, is now an
obscure word to Yoruba people. They there-
fore accept: the popular etymology which ex-
plains the word as emo ti Noah bi, “Child born
by Noah”! Noah in the Bible, you see, was a
“blameless man in his generation’: so the cir-
cumstances fit beautifully, and folk etymology
is satisfied. It does not bother to check whether
this explanation came before the Yorubas were
introduce to the story of Noah in the Bible or
after, .

Popular eiymology is in linguistics what the
“Why sttries” are in literature: tall stories for
popular consumption. Because of the peculiar
gait of the chameleon which seems to be treading
circumspectly like an angel where fools rush in,
Yoruba mythology ‘says that the chameleon
was the animal sent by the creator to inspect
Whether enough of the primordial waters of
chaos had been covered by land to allow human
dwelling. So came the chameleon, treading
gingerly and looking for some dry spot to set
his next footstep. Hence, its permanent manner
of walking.

Similar stories are told to explain the “broken
calabash” which a tortoise carries about behind
it, the comb on a cock’s head, why cats and
mice are sworn enemies, why the snake crawls
on its belly, why there are “white” men and
“black” men, and so on. These stories are fiction;
and so is popular etymology.

Yoruba folklore is now passing from oral
tradition into the pages of books, and just as
much popular etymology passed into the Bib-
lical tecord, so is Yoruba folk etymology pass-
ing into books. The folklorists do not warn us
that it is folk etymology; in fact they say that
this or that word “literally means”’ or is “derived
from”. Once it gets into books, another folk
attitude develops: it must be so because it says
so in a book,

The traditionalist is a potential fundamen-
talist. Tell him that “God” did not put the
rainbow in the sky.and that it is not a sign of a
covenant that “God” will no longer destroy
“the whole earth” with water, and he will turn

These questions are of popular interest. The
folk etymologist sets about to answer them
from his limited monolingual resources, thinking
that Yoruba can be explained completely within
Yoruba. “Comparative philology, however,
adventures into the unknown, and discovers
new criteria by which language can be adjudged
possible or impossible.”* The monolingual
approach is like “‘intra-Hebraic etymologizing”’:
James Barr concedes that it “has been the source
of much trouble, from which the use of cognate

languages has done much to liberate us.”

It is hoped that future articles will liberate
the reader from the confusion of intra-Yoruba
etymologizing—seeking the etymology of ob-
scure Yoruba words within the confines of the
Yoruba language. The approach will be philo-
logical: we shall demonstrate the meaning of
such words by comparison with their cognates
in the Semitic languages, in Ancient Egyptian,
and other Afro-asiatic languages.

G. M. HOPKINS—A Precocious Outsider?

~

By

Pot Nou
Department of English, University of Nigeria, Nsukka

_— a poet, Gerard Manley Hopkins was most success-
ful; though many have proclaimed him otherwise.
For Middleton Mury, Hopkins’ failure as a poet was
due to the “starvation of experience which his vocation
imposed upon him.” Professor Abbot, who edited three
volumes of his correspondence said that the quarrel
“between the priest and the poet was never fully recon-
ciled in his mind... .he seems to have felt increasingly
the difficulty of reconciling the offices of priest and poet.
Hopkins the poet was too severely tried by the discipline
he thought necessary to Hopkins the poet to flourish
freely.”? He concluded that Hopkins suffered slow
martyrdom. asa poet. Dr Gardner also stated that “the
story of his (Hopkins’) life presents from one angle, the
tragic conflict of a man torn between two vocations. .

from another angle, it represents the heroic struggle of a
man who is so completely dedicated to one profession
that he deliberately sacrifices another possible and in
some ways more exciting profession, because he is sure
that God wills it to be so.”* |

But Chester Burns in the article “G. M. Hopkins, Poet
of Ascetic and Aesthetic Conflict” contended that “reli-
gious orders have no crying need of poets; nor yet again
craving for the honour of their company. . . .Poets may
not be granted indiscriminate concessions, amounting to
mild license, by religious orders,....hence did G.
Hopkins at the opening of his religious career regard
poetry with misgivings and the obligations of religious
life more stringent than in reality they are. Yet with —
them he cast his lot and to them he cleaved, leaving the
culture of poetry to whomsoever it might properly —

The object of this article is to analyse the Middleton
Mury and Fr. Burns schools of thought and show where
each went wrong. Fr. Burns went all out to stress the
extreme view that Hopkins the priest cared very little,
if he cared at all, for Hopkins the poet, that whatever
were the achievements, of Hopkins the poet were trite
pursuits to the true Hopkins the priest who saw poetry
as incidental to whoever wrote it. This is partly erro-
Neous. For G. M. Hopkins was poet before becoming

mince expressions in propagating them. He relished
what he felt was good poetry and accepted his mission
as a poet with holy resignation. In a letter to Dixon
he stated:

“I am ashamed at the expression of high regard
which your last letter and others have contained,
kind and touching as they are, I do not know whether
I ought to reply to them or not. This I say: my
vocation puts before me_a standard so high that a
higher can be found nowhere else. The question then
before me is not whether I am willing (if I may guess
what is in your mind) to make a sacrifice of hopes
of fame (let us suppose) but whether I am not to
undergo a severe judgment from God for the loth-
ness I have shown in making it, for the reserves I may
have in my heart made, for the backward glances
[have given with my hand upon the plough, for the
waste of time the very compositions you admire may

_ have caused and their preoccupation of the mind

which belonged to more sacred and more binding
duties, for the disquiet and the thoughts of vainglory
they have given rise to. A purpose may look smooth
and perfect from without but be frayed and faltering
from within. I have never wavered in my vocation
but I have not lived up to it... However I shall in my
present mind continue to compose, as occasion shall fairly
allow... .”""4
W.A.M. Peters cried that “how to construe a tragic-
conflict from this determined state of mind is a thing I
cannot understand.” There was obviously a conflict,
but it might not have been tragic. Hopkins, right from
the start of his humble acknowledgment of regards,
struck a pose. He felt ashamed or was it embarrassed,
at the amount of praise being lavished on his poetry by
Dixon and other admirers. He was undecided as to
whether he should make a reply or not. But he did make
the reply after all and that reply as well as several others
are accessible to Hopkins’ scholars everywhere today.
He dutifully toasted to his religious vocation and the
poet's predicament. The question was not whether he
must sacrifice fame or not. That he had done already.
But the menacing question was how much punishment
he would get for his reluctance, in making the sacrifice,

Hopkins had condemned the Victorian tapestry of
Tennyson and Browning’s academicism. He thus
designed a language style with relish for “a term with
tong on it, with a savour and flavour all its own, with
sharpness of edge. Some of these words he found in
Welsh poetry, compound words of noun-noun, noun-
adjective, adjective-adjective; often he did not stop at
compound words but used the epithet formed of the
object and the verb as in ‘roll-rock,’ ‘dare-gale,’ ‘lack-
lustre,’ lacing the sense so tightly that it can hardly
breathe. He can ring adjectives like a chime of bells:”
- Tatter-tassel-tangled and dingle-a dingled

Dandy-hung. dainty head.

“Stringing his words together more by instinct than by
intellect, he found it dreadful to explain the meaning of
aphrasein cold blood. . .” But his point had been made
and by his virgin exploration of language forms he
carried poetry overbridge into the twentieth century
when he.dug up its Celtic roots, Further he injected his
_ coinage of new metaphysical values which glued both
matter and matter-essence or material and its existence
into his poetic pattern. These new values, the inscape and
instress of things gave most of his poems their peculiar
greatness. Thus, by the nineteenth, century, Hopkirts
was already writing for the twentieth century, a hund-
red years ahead. of his contemporaries. He had devel-
oped a succinctness and precision unusual in an age
muffled by a flux of ideas and philosophies.

Hopkins’ revolutionary disposition was not just
confined to literary criticism. Earlier as an under-
graduate at Oxford, he had fired the Church of England.
On August 28, 1886, he wrote to Cardinal Newman:
“T am anxious to become a Catholic, and I thought
you might possibly be able to see me for a short time...
Ido not-want to be helped to any conclusions of belief,
for Iam thankful to say my mind ismadeup.” His mind
was made up. Till today, critics and analysts have not
explained what spiritual cataclysm brought about this
sudden and decisive change of ideal. Martin Carroll in
“G. M. Hopkins and the Society of Jesus” Immortal
Diamond ed. N. Weyard, (Sheed & Ward) London
1949, p. 3 suggested that the reasons for this decision
can be conjectured, “the possible motives can be
weighed, but the real secret of his vocation seems
likely to remain unknown.” The real secret can equally
be conjectured and the most handy conjecture is that

Hopkins was a restless man, 4 dissatisfied man who
refused to give in to the status quo. He did not just stop
with turning his back on the Church of his homeland,
he carried the war far into the labyrinths of the spiritual
theatre where the drama took place and he emerged
not only a protesting protestant but an exclusive
Spiritual of a conservative Order. Even in the apparent
solace of the Ignatian monastery, Hopkins occasionally
exposed his deep-laid scepticism, his unique personal
understanding of things about him. In December 1867,
he wrote to Urquhart after his conversion: “I am. glad
you go to confession although there is nothing of
Sacrament in the ordinance as you use it, but still it has
its value ex: opere operantis and in some cases the Shadow
of Peter may cure where the touch of Peter is not to be
had; But this kind of reasoning is dangerous and likely
to mislead.” Hopkins’ beliefs were thus anchored in a
personal and private understanding of dogma and he
refused any external influences intruding into this
peculiar area of understanding. His insight was projected
into things instead, permeated them, absorbed them
and gave them expression because the Spirit which could
make and unmake lived in him, He brought all the
force of this Spirit to bear on all that came in contact
with him and was able to transfix them and transform
them in so doing,

When Hopkins brought his unique techniques, his
mysticism, and his intimate spiritual traumas upon
poetry, he laid a corner-stone upon which poetry was
subsequently to be built. The poet began to identify
himself most vigorously with whatever he wrote.
It is interesting to note how Hopkins’ modes have
featured in most current poetry even now, toward the
close of the twentieth century. His use of effective
language and direct expression gave him a distinguishing
characteristic as a forebear of Dylan Thomas and T. S.
Eliot. In this Poem for instance he achieved a climactic
simplicity which fascinates the eye and the mind by its
sheer lucidity. |

Look at the stars! Look, look up at the skies!
O Look at all the fire-folk sitting in the air!
Look, Look: a May-mess, likeon orchard boughts!
Look! March-bloom.
Here, logic of the grammatical is zealously guarded,
with a play upon word logic. Hopkins no longer argues,
no longer tries to clarify his views by argument,

the edge of the Sahara desert, was to protect the

against the Muslims. When, dan Fodio’s former
pupil Yunfa became ruler in 1799 he continued
this oppressive behaviour, eventually attacking
the Muslims and killing many during the Ramadan

* fasting. Dan Fodio moved to Gudu in February

what is now the north-eastern part of Sokoto ~

Province, fighting and raiding into Zamfara.
In mid-century they destroyed Birnin Zamfara
and the Sarkin Zamfara, Malu, gave land to Babari,
the Sarkin Gobir, on the Rima river. Babari
built a new capital there in 1757 which he called
Alkalawa as it was built on farmlands which had
belonged to the Alkalin Zamfara.

At this time a section of the Toronkawa Fulani
was residing at Marata,. within the bounds of
Gobir, and in 1744 a son had been born to the
clanhead Fodio. As he grew up he was sent to
study in Agades and on his return he settled at
Degel and taught and preached, soon establishing
a wide reputation for piety and learning. This was
Usman dan Fodio who was to head the religious
reformation movement which developed into the
Fulani empire of Sokoto. Dan Fodio’s fame spread
to Alkalawa and the Gobir king Bawa summoned
him as tutor to his two sons, one of whom was
named Yunfa.

The Gobirawa were nominally Muslims but
practised pagan customs and devil worship.
Dan Fodio won numbers of converts and earned
the envy of the Gobir court because of his popula-
rity. In retaliation the Gobir Sarki Bunu Nafata

tkey called him by the title Shehu, and Chief of
the Muslims, Sarkin Musulmi.

In June Yunfa marched on the Shehu. The
Muslims met the Gobirawa at Tabkin Kwotto
and inflicted a decisive defeat, whereupon Yunfa
retired to Alkalawa and wrote to all the Hausa
states to resist the growing power of the Fulani.
The Shehu countered this by summoning Fulani
leaders and Muslims who were former pupils of
his from all over Hausaland and giving them flags
to carry out a jihad, or religious war.

By the end of the 1804 rains the Shehu had
assembled a force with which he felt able to attack
the Gobirawa in their capital. As well as his own
immediate Muslim followers who had been at
Tabkin Kwotto he was now supported by the
Katsina Fulani clans who had been expelled by the
Hausa sarki and also by a force of ‘Tuareg. This
large combined force was placed under the
supreme command of the Shehu’s younger
brother Abdullahi. At this stage, apart from the
Tuareg, the Shehu’s forces were still largely
untrained in the art of war. They possessed but
few horsemen and the warriors were unprotected
by any kind of armour.

At the beginning of the dry season the column
drew near Alkalawa and commenced raiding in the
outlying towns and villages, culminating in an

lengthy warfare. In all the other states there were
Fulani already established, some of them in posi-
tions of trust when the jihad started: they were
able to approach the problem of overthrowing the
Hausa kings from within, in other words. But
with the fall of Alkalawa the Fulani were able to go
ahead and establish their empire on the lines along
Which it would exist until the coming of the
British and after. The area of Sokoto including
Gobir came under the direct administration of the
Sultan whilst the Hausa states under their new
Fulani emirs accepted his overlordship. The two
*xceptions were Daura and Argungu who man-
aged by various means to retain their independence.

The battle for Alkalawa and its subsequent fall

are the main events which led to this massive
change of power in Hausaland, and, indeed, to
changes far beyond its borders where Bida,
Bauchi and Adamawa also assumed their identi-
ties with Fulani emirs who had been given flags
by the Shehu.

These changes have in the main remained
unaltered down to the present day, for throughout
regionalization, independence and the formation ~
of states the same ruling families adorn the Muslim
emirates which once formed part of the Sokoto
empire, and the Sultan of Sokoto is still regarded —
by the Muslims as their spiritual head, as Sarkin

leading to the capture of Alkalawa.

THE -ERU cFESTIVAL

By

E. A. MoOroHUNFOLA

N the words of Franz Boas, ‘Tradition is the

totality of the mental and physical reactions and
activities that characterized the behaviour of the
individuals composing a social group collectively
and individually in relation to their natural
‘environment, to other groups, to members of the
group itself and to each individual himself.”

Nowhere in Nigeria could it be remarked that a

tradition serves as the national link—so great—
""as it does exist in Igbirra land. ‘The Eku-masque-
raders season is the most eagerly awaited festival,
and the most remembered season in the Igbirra land.

This is not to say, however, that there are no
other traditions in Igbirra land. Mention may be
made of the Echori, Echane—which form_ the
festival of the ““New Yam’’; the Egbe festival which
is generally the first festival in the calendar year,
and which is also recognized as the festival for
“saving seeds.”

While the observation of the traditional rites is
generally regarded as “taboo” to both Christians
and Moslems in other parts of the country, the
situation here offers a sharp contrast. Igbirra land,
with about 300,000 in population, can convincingly
boast of 95 per cent Moslems and less than
2 per cent Christians. But then the allocation of
3 per cent to the believers according to the
traditional pattern seems an exaggeration. And
while you have mosques in hundreds and churches
in units; you hardly could get a shrine in the
whole land. From my observation it appears that
the people do not hold too rigidly to the tenets of
these imported religions. A casual observer of the
Eku Festival would no doubt take all the people
as believers in traditional religion.

94

The Eku tradition has a fascinating genesis. The
tradition history recalls that an Igbirra ancestor
once had two sons with names “Ododo” and
“Ogbayi’”. These two sons were envious of one
another, and the belief that people who die would
surely return again to the world, had a great
effect on their subsequent behaviour.

Since Ogbaji was the younger in that incarnation,
he thought that he would not allow Ododo to be
his senior in the next incarnation. With this in
mind, Ododo’s sudden illness provoked Ogulaji’s
suicide.

Soon after Ogbaji’s funeral, his sons quickly
made Eku to represent him before Ododo’s Eku
should come out. Thus rivalry characterized the
tku festival in Igbirra land. And the much
cherished Eku’s festival began with Ekuogba the
first Eku in Igbirra land.

The mysteries of the Eku festival are secret and
women may not usually know them. The Eku is
considered as a supernatural inquisitor who comes
to enquire into the general domestic conduct of
people especially that of women and criminals.

It is also believed that soon after a funeral, the
Eku parade the quarter where someone has died
with a view to bear messages from the family to
the deceased. No doubt, therefore, both the night
Eku and the day Eku are invited to play for the
dead person.

The most important Eku festival is that of
Ekuechi which generally comes up around the
tenth of December every year. This memorable
season lasts for only two days. Both men and

women spend generously for feasting during this
festival.

PROSODY FOR HAUSA POETRY

By

S. A. BAYERO

eae is preceded by poetry. It is to study poetry
to its full meaning that prosody is inovated. Thus
the poetry of any language, however related it is to

another, may, after deep investigation at least, need its -

own prosody.

Hausa in relation to Arabic

Arabic began to get into Hausa as far back as the
fifteenth century for, “before the end of the fifteenth
centry, El-Maghili a divine and jurist, visited Hausaland
and founded the tradition of Arabic letters... .” later
to be known as ajami. (Quotation from the Fulani
Empire of Sokoto by H. A. S. Johnston). His visit and its
subsequent results had been made possible by the fact
that Islam had been established in Hausaland at the
beginning of the fifteenth century—in Kano and Katsina
at least. So, through Islam came many Arabic words in
Hausa language such as ‘salla’, ‘liman’ ‘alwalla’, ‘layya’,
which have been read in the Holy Quran and other
religious books. Such words have been adopted into
Hausa for want of simpler and explicit Hausa ones.

Despite the large number of Arabic loan words in
Hausa, its structure has not been altered, as we find a
sharp difference between Arabic and Hausa structures,
We see that while in Arabic the verb precedes its sub-
ject, the opposite is the case with Hausa.

Hausa poetry in relation to Arabic poetry
Though it may be said that Arabic poetry has in-

31

fluence on the Hausa learned songs, yet if we look into
the matter more closely, we will find that the Arabic
poetry studied generally in this country is that of the
‘Seven Odes’ none of which resembles any of our learned
songs in theme and structure. Each of the Seven Odes
is begun with what is. known in. Arabic poetry as
‘Gazal’ which is not practised in Hausa poetry.

Some people seem to be convinced that it was Isa
Maikware, the son of Shehu Usmanu, that first compo-
sed and wrote down Hausa poetry in ‘ajami’. But I
believe that somebody, somewhere in Hausaland must
have composed and written some Hausa poems some-
time from the time that El-Maghili founded “ajami’
to the Fulani rising. It is even believed in some quarters
that the Fulani Muslim leaders discouraged the poetry
of the time the themes of which were believed to be to
some extent contrary to the principles of Islam. Sub-
sequently the composers and writers destroyed their
compositions and abstained from any further move in
the business. It is hard to believe that Hausa remained
without poetry up to the time of the Fulani rule.
Furthermore, it is a spite to Hausas to say that of all
people it is somebody to whom. Hausa is a second lang-
age that first composed a Hausa poem. The fact that
those Fulani Muslim leaders had contemporary Hausa
learned people conversant with Arabic and its poetry
cannot be denied. —

There are at present some Western scholars who argue

w0xmoZMBZK9IE8y62XjF,"For settlement of the Ife-Modakeke war, the “Treaty
of Peace’ provided that the Modakeke must evacuate
their town and migrate westwards into Ibadan territory
and that the Ife should then reoccupy Ie-Ife, However,
the Modakeke refused to carry out this provision, and
the commissioners of the Lagos government who came
into the interior in Sept.-October 1886 to see to the
execution of the treaty had to give up the Ife issue as
hopeless. Between Dec. 1886 and Jan. 1887, the [badan
allies of Modakeke and the Ekitiparapo and Yjebu allies
of Ife got tired of the stalemate and left.2* But since the
Modakeke would not honour the treaty and move
away or, as the Ife were prepared to concede after some
time, break up Modakeke and come to live with the
Ife within the walls of Ie-Ife, the Ife would not term-
inate hostilities and could not reoccupy Ie-ffe. The truth
is that the Ife people had come to such a state of mind
that they could not reconcile themselves to the con-
tinued existence of Modakeke, because Modakeke had
become the living symbol of their suffering and dis-
grace. But to expect the Modakeke, who had not been
beaten in battle but had repeatedly worsted the Ife,
to agree voluntarily to evacuate their town was, as it
turned out, asking for the impossible.

Nle-Ife therefore remained in ruins. In 1893, the
Tbadan-llorin war was terminated and all wars in the
country came to an end. Yet, Ile-Ife continued to remain
unoccupied. A visitor to the town in 1894 August
described it as ‘a very melancholy spectacle’ and said
that “partidges can be shot among the ruins of the
houses’.*® It was in this month that, thanks again to the
intervention of the Lagos government, some sort of
settlement was at last patched up between Ife and
Modakeke and the Ife began to reoccupy the town
which they had fled full twelve years before.

The story of Ife-Modakcke relations continues deep
into the present century. But the sad history of Ife in the
nineteenth century must now be concluded. Starting
out into the first half of that century on a note of hope,
Ife slumped very badly in the second half of it. Of the
last fifty years of the century, the Ife people spent not
less than sixteen in forced exile, while their famous
town existed asa jungle of ruins. It took the town a long
time to recover physically from this disaster, and even,
today signs of its after effects have not entirely dis-
appeared. During the first decades of this century,
innumerable expansive heaps of rubble interspersed the

38

quarters of Ile-Ife, marking the areas which did not
manage to get built up quickly after 1894.

Moreover, any scholar interested in Ife is bound to
consider it strange that the products of Ife’s great
sculpture in bronze, terra-cotta and stones have to be -
almost entirely dug out of the ground and that no
family or individual artist is known who has carried
into our day the artistic skills which had produced
these famous sculptures. The present writer believes
that it is in the nineteenth century experience of Ife
that one must find the answer to this question. The
tradition of Ife has it that before the destructions of
le-Ife, the palace as well as princely and chiefly com-
pounds and public shrines were veritable art galleries.
There were annual festivals which required newly made
sculptures to be placed in particular shrines, and there
were many femilies and artists who lived by making
these sculptfires. But in the hour of flight from the
burning city, people tried to hide or carry away the
most valued of the art treasures so that they might not
fall into the enemy’s hands; and both during battle
and in the years of exile, the rich compounds collapsed,
burrying their treasures. While the annual rituals could
not be performed, the artists who had lived by min-
istering to them, had to turn to other things. Many
families now have it according to their tradition that
when they at last revived their annual rites, the former
sources of sculptures had disappeared, and they had to
polish up old ones every year.

Of the compounds which collapsed in the nineteenth
century holocausts, one was, according to Ife traditions,
the Wunmonije compound from where the richest
collection of Ife bronze heads has been dug up in this
century.°° Concerning what happened to the art
treasures of Ife in the wars, we are fortunate to have
accounts written by the Governor G. 'T. Carter of Lagos
during two visits to Ife in 1894 and 1896. “I was taken”,
he wrote, “to see an oval stone flattened on both sides
which is an object of worship, the upper surface has
been polished apparently by rubbing against another
stone, and a little shrine has been made for it in a wood.
The Ifes say their enemies have frequently stolen it,
but it has always been returned, as disaster surely over-
takes the person who removes it”, He also saw the
Oranyan staff which he described as ‘shaped like an
exaggerated elephant’s tusk—studded with iron nails’.
“The most curious and inexplicable of all the Ife relics,

zkxqoZMBZK9IE8y6fHh2,"he have done that without someone picking him up
along the road, he wondered. He pondered over this
for a few hours but the more he thought about the
latest aberration of Africa the more confused he became.
He made up his mind that he would query the Messenger,
_ for so Ajayi was nick-named) because if there was
anything he abhorred, it was double-dealing.

Smartly the Messenger presented himself to the Man
of God. The conversation was first of all a friendly one
but the Messenger had made up his mind to reveal his
secrets. He was prepared to let the white man know that
his theatrical behaviours were only viewed with African
sympathy; otherwise he would have demonstrated his
gifted supernatural powers too,

The Man of God demanded from the Messenger how
he made, within a single day, a journey normally done
in two days. Ajayi replied in his dialect that he shrank
the road. He further explained that it was possible for
him to make the road become longer.

That was something alien to Samie. Back in Mailain,
he was taught by his father not to believe any magical
acts nor spiritual powers for they were lies. Also during
his briefings at the field Headquarters in Lagos, he was
warned about the wizardry of Africans and their not
unusual incredible stories and beliefs. He dismissed
Ajayi’s story as nonsense that he must have been picked
up by a cyclist along the Egbe-Iorin path. Ajayi then,
reminded him that he brought the first bicycles to Egbe,
that horses were used only in the township. So the one
that could pick him up must be someone walking on foot
as he did; but Samie was not convinced.

To prove his point, Ajayi requested that the two should
run a race, That he would go on foot and that Samie
would ride his motor cycle on the Egbe-Iorin pathway.
He bet that he would get to the city of Torin several
hours before the one that would ride on a motor cycle,

This was a challenge to Samie. Though sober and of
contrite spirit, he would not allow that type of boasting
to go unchallenged. He agreed to race with his messenge
and a special day was fixed for the sport. |

Allalong the people of Egbe had been wondering why
the white man was so ignorant. Ajayi would perform his
duties at the Mission and in the Church to perfection.
He often preached in the newly-opened surrounding
churches too, but he would always return to his art in
the evening. The fact was that his herbal healing was
becoming more known than before, and he combined

¢

48

the new faith with the old in such a perplexing manner
that the Egbe people watched him in, awe. Being well-
known in the city he commanded réspect but was also
clever enough to make use of any’ new situation to his
own advantage.

Presently the appointed day came. Both men were
prepared for the*race. Ajayi had discussed. the matter
with his ageing father who in turn gave final tips and the
use of a blue handkerchief purchased from the Land of
Blue Waters. This had greater power.

At about ten o'clock in the morning, Samie brought
out. his motor cycle, and Ajayi too came and stood
beside him; but they had to wait for another half an
hour before they started.

Watching the spectacle were children and adults.
They were all grinning and making fun of the white man
in the language he understood not. At the given time
they started off. Instead of running, Ajayi walked leisurely
down, the path, but before he could take two steps, the
Missionary had vanished into the bush! The end of the
race wasto beat Ilorin.

At about six hours later, Ajayi known at Ilorin as the
Mail Carrier, arrived at the Mission House. On his
arrival he told the Missionary in-charge that the Rev.
Samuel Samuelson I was coming behind on his motor
cycle; but he had arrived before him on foot. It was
amazing that the Missionary at Ilorin was unable to note
how Ajayi Ogun put his words, Later in the evening
Samie roared into the Mission compound. He rode right
into the Mission House to be told that Ajayi was there
already ! He neither believed those who spoke to him nor
his ears until he saw Ajayi. He was confounded. His
immediate reaction was utter surprise but he refused to
say a word. He merely collected the few letters that
came and headed back to his station. |

In the early hours of the following moming after
praying to God for further direction, he wrote a letter
to his parents detailing what he had seen but was unable
to explain how the thing happened or how one could
shrink a given distance. He ended that portion of his
letter by merely saying, “This is Africa where things are
different indeed.”

For two months he waited for letters from his parents.
He had thought that his pious father would find a
meaning to all and explain how a person could walk
faster than a motor cycle; otherwise his work at the new
station would be blocked by the magical acts of Ajayi.

z0xqoZMBZK9IE8y60Xig,"But no word came from his father. He wondered what
could have happened and thought perhaps his father
had become disappointed on that portion of the letter;
and that the home mission too would reconsider his
appointment. He worried each day about the develop-
ments back home and the confrontation on the field.
But he dared not discuss the matter with the triumphant
Ajayi nor any of the spectators that watched the begin-
ning of the race. Within him he kept his peace and hoped
he would not fall into pieces before an explanation could
be found.

On his part, Ajayi had gone round to tell the church
members and non-christians alike how he demonstrated
to the missionary the superiority of Africans. He con-
tinued to say that if a cunning man could be outwitted
then it was tithe to reconsider his cleverness. Not many
people took him seriously. The church elders even had a
disdainful view about the way Ajayi had behaved to-
wards the Man. of God. On hearing the whole story and
the arguments that developed between the missionary and
the Messenger, they were saddened. A decision to send a
delegation to the Rev. Samuel Samuelson II was taken.
They had hoped to plead with him not to be disheartened
about the noble work he started but to continue like a
gallant soldier.

Not knowing their mission, the young exuberant
missionary received the delegation of elders with wide-
open arms. He sat them in his office and served tea.
After sometime, Elder Benjamin Jacobs spoke. He said
the Man, of God should not be offended by the behaviours
of Ajayi Ogun, but that the majority of the people
were for him. The elders concluded by saying that
Ajayi had not been a good man all along, but because of
his influence he became an important person. Nothing
happened. without him and without him many things
would be at a standstill.

Instead of replying, the missionary took out his
King James Version Bible and opened it to the Psalms.
He read the first three chapters, and then prayed for the
blessing of God on the Church and the fold. There
after, he bade the amazed elders good afternoon.

On a certain Wednesday, Ajayi returned from Torin
with the weck’s mail. Among them was a letter from the
young Missionary’s parents. He knew the answers to his
puzzles would be in that letter. With enough anxiety to
tear up the whole batch of letters from his homeland,

he opened the letter. He glanced through, then read
and re-read the piece of paper. But there were no answers
to his questions. The old man gave antidotes for other
problems but not the one in which Ajayi Ogun, the
Messenger was the principal figure. He felt there was
little use in referring such matters to anyone, anyway.
That was his mission. He was there to build the place.
He must find answers to his own problems and to restore
the prestige of the Mission to where it belonged.

For two weeks, he thought of what to do, and the
type of punishment to measure out for his Messenger, .
He finally came out with a most ideal method of treating
the matter.

He had announced to his followers that there would be ~
a meeting after the second service on a given Sunday.
For the meeting, there was no room for the spectators
because almost everybody was there, Even the Oba
himself came because the news had gone round that
Ajayi Ogun had caused a sensation at the Mission House
and that he would be disciplined by the Church,
Rev. Samuel Samuelson Il overheard the rumour in the .
church that day and he became more perplexed because
he had not discussed his plans with anyone. He was
quite infuriated and almost cursed the gossiping Africans!

When the members were in, he stood up among them
and read from the Old Testament and New Testament,
prayed five times before addressing the congregation
formally. In his talk he told the members how important
it was to keep the church free of idolatory, wizardry,
and unnatural manners. For three hours he talked |
passionately until the non-church goers began to leave
one by one. Even the Obabecame restive but ays waited

in deference to the Missionary. .

See this timethere were no names ee
and members of good standing in the church began to
wonder who would wear the elaborate description.
But the suspense was long before the Missionary revealed
the person involved. He announced that Ajayi Ogun
would be removed from the position as the Chief
Messenger for the;Mission and also he would have to
leave the church. There was silence throughout the
building but before members could leave, the deposed
man got up and thanked the congregation for his asso-
ciation with them but promised that he would go back
to his herbs and healing and would also establish a new
native church which would have no foreign influence!

0kxroZMBZK9IE8y623hS,"only to find his wife staring hard at him, He just
returned from a business trip.

The gaze was diverted by the sudden shatter of
another man’s glass of drink. His wife had been in the
forefront of the polygamy-bride-wealth attack on
African men and women. He, too, a big businessman,
had just returned from a business trip only the previous
week: from Chicago, and had another planned for the
following week for New York with two days’ stop over
in Chicago.

I was feeling uncomfortable for the men. As if to
divert the attention back at me, Jean, a very attractive
lady in her carly twenties, asked me if I believed in
polygamy.

“Like believing in Santa Claus! Of course I do.”

“How many do you intend to marry, Mr?” The way
she said it, very clinical and cynical, “A hundred may-
be?”

“Oh, not that many. Six will be quite all right by
me,” I replied in all seriousness.

“Six?” another lady in a ravishing and tantalizing
low-cut dress asked in disbelief.

“Yes, six, One for every day of the week,” I rubbed
it in. I was enjoying every bit of it all.

“What about the seventh day?” asked Mr Stevens,
who, from the way he asked the question, undoub-
tedly looked like the boss in his family.

“That’s the day of rest,” I replied.

There was a big roar of laughter, mostly from the
men—particularly those who had been suppressing any
feeling of fun under the watchful eyes of their wives.

I couldn’t help it. But in order not to spoil the fun
I just smiled, while inside me my ribs felt like splitting
for the suppressed laughter. Meanwhile, the hostess,
Mrs Lands, was trying every means to break up the
trend of the conversation. Her husband, however, was
enjoying it very much and he wanted it to continue as
much as I wanted it to. But I had decided I would not
push it unless pushed, Just as the hostess breezed in
from the kitchen the hundredth time attempting to
attract our attention to the sweet smelling dish she and
her neighbour had been moving from the kitchen to
the dining-room, her husband interrupted her.

“But tell me one thing, young man. es
practice polygamy?”

“Yes,” joined in another man as he lit what must

51

have been his tenth cigarette. “And that business about
bride-wealth you mentioned.”

I did not know the dinner party was going to be an
anthropology class.

“Well, let us start from the family,” I began.

“Tn an overall view of the typical African family
there are two striking aspects in which it differs from
a typical American family. First is the idea of the
extended family as opposed to the nuclear family
which exists in this country. The other aspect is poly-
gamy. Among very many African tribes many men .
have more than one wife and the family is, therefore,
made up ofa man and his wives and all of their children. _
It cannot be overemphasized that the African family is
not just husband, wife or wives, and their children, It
embraces much more. Uncles, aunts, grandmothers and
grandfathers, great-uncles and great-aunts, cousins and
any blood relations are part of the family, referred to
as the extended family.

“After marriage negotiations have been completed,
a wedding ceremony usually takes place when a cash -
payment or payment in goods is made by the groom
to the bride’s parents. This is called the payment of
bride-wealth. It should not be regarded as ‘buying
one’s wife’ as some people here this evening have
intimated. Its payment legalizes the marriage and,
therefore, it is of great significance. Hence, we could
regard it as the equivalent of a marriage certificate in
western societies. Its payment also functions as a bond
between the two families concerned and thus serves to
strengthen the cordial relationship between them,
Payment of bride-wealth also underlines the respect
shown to the bride and her family since any marriage’
without this payment signifies distespect, humiliation,
and ingratitude on the part of the bridegroom. Thus
we find that even the highly educated and westernized
African marrying another holds this view and will do
likewise whether he weds his bride in the church, in a
western court, or by native law and custom in the
traditional society. | 7

“The bride’s father gives some portion of the bride-
wealth to the mother of the girl, the portion varying
from family to family. This amount she shares with
members of her family. The bride herself gets a small
share, usually in the form of presents, and the remaining
amount is shared by the father with his brothers and
sisters. The sharing of the bride-wealth is one aspect of

arrangements for their tickets,” Kwame said. “Oh
that’s alright,” said Adeoye. “I hope Mr Adio will please
direct you round to the booking office.” “And thanks
for patronizing us.”

All the while, Kwame was eyeing the big safe. “This
wont be hard work,’ he thought.

As the door closed behind them, Adeoye wondered
why the man’s secretary could not have done the
booking simply by telephone.

When they got out, Kwame shook Joseph’s hand
vigorously and thanked him.

“All you have to do now is to fold your hands and
watch me work,” Kwame assured Joseph and left the
premises of Eagle Airlines.

Kwame on getting home that evening went to his
drawer and brought out some tools. He did not forget
to bring out the ice-pick he stole from Alfred’s the day
before. :

‘T could as well kill two birds with one stone’ he

_ thought. He ’phoned the airport to check on the

arrival of the plane and after some delay was told that
the plane landed promptly at 18.30 G.M.T.
At 19.00 hours that night, Kwame set out. First, he

was going to deal with Anita then later, the Eagles

Manager’s office-safe. ‘With this job’s success’ he
thought, I will flaunt my cash on peoples’ face and later
I will set up a livestock farm.’

‘As for Joe, the moment I lay my hands on those
precious stones, he is as good as dead.’ Kwame kept
thinking.

He went out into the street and threw a coin at the
beggar who was begging desperately under the
street lamp. Then, taking to back-streets and alleys, he
got to Anita’s house. ,

With the agility of a monkey, he hoisted himself
into Anita’s compound and climbed the stairs that led
into the silent house. He noticed that Anita’s room was
in darkness. ‘I’ll have to wait for the bitch,’ he cursed.

‘With the aid of a skeleton key, he found no trouble
in entering Anita’s room. The room was furnished to
taste and the long curtains provided a solution for
Kwame’s hiding place.

Kwame wanted to smoke. But it would be a give-
away so, he didn’t. After a 15-minute wait, he heard
smart steps and guessed they were Anita's.

A key turned, and Anita came in. Peering at her from

behind the curtain, Kwame only saw a silhouette

figure. When Anita turned her back to Kwame,
apparently she was going to put on the light, he steal-
thily moved out of his hiding place and caught up with
Anita.
Her horror was an education. Kwame clasped his left
hand tightly on her mouth and with her went to the
light switch. He threw the switch and a flood of light
came on. ; :
When Anita looked back and saw who it was, she
struggled frantically like a trapped mouse, but she has
Kwame’s strength to reckon with.
“Bid the world goodbye!” Kwame said to her gruffly.
He then brought out the ice-pick and raised it. The
raised hand came down, with great force and the point
of the pick landed on Anita’s neck—' THWACK.’

_ Just then a knock sounded on the door followed

immediately by yet another knock.

“Anita!” a voice called from outside. Anita’s room was
three storeys up and any desperate attempt at jumping
out for Kwame would result in broken legs or even his
neck. Moreover the avarice for richness made him
resolve not to jump. Composing himself, Kwame

- went and opened the door and he blocked the entrance

with his figure. “Yes?” Kwame said to the thin figure

_ of a man in front of him. When corporal Taiwo—

55

Anita’s friend saw who came to open the door, he
caught his breath sharply. 7

“{_I wanted to see Anita!” Taiwo stammered.

“She is out and who are you?” Kwame failed to recog-
“J am the caretaker.”

Thought Kwame, ‘He would give the police a good
description of me, ll have to fix him too.’ :

Taiwo who knew that something bad was going on
in Kwame’s mind started to back-pedal. “Maybe I'll
come tomorrow,” said Taiwo. “Let me give you
now,” Kwame said and dipped into his pocket. He
fumbled for his knuckle-duster and quickly fixed it on
his finger. “No, I'll come tomorrow,” Taiwo, said and
saw Kwame’s hand’ coming out of the pocket. He
noticed a glint of metal and quickly jumped for the
staircase.

Kwame’s quick strides caught up with Taiwo’s thin
figure and he landed Taiwo a crunching blow on the
back of his head.

Taiwo’s knees buckled under the impact and he went
down like a pole-axed bull. Kwame was alarmed,

10xtoZMBZK9IE8y6k3hY,"‘This cisy might be dead.’ Kwame thought. He bent
over Taiwo’s limp body and began to search his
pockets. ‘

He broke out in a cold sweat when he brought out a
square police identity card. “A cop!” He said aloud.
“Well, I am sunk!’ He kicked Taiwo out of his way

and blundered down the staircase.

He headed for Joseph’s place and got there in record
time.

“Joe”, he said “we are sunk!”

“What! you mean there’s no money again?” Joseph
asked alarmed.

“Money! The cops are after us. I have fixed Anita and
her lover-cop met me!”

“Oh! what have you done to Anita?”

“She is dead!” He told him in a matter-of-fact tone.
“What are you going to do now?” Joseph asked
alarmed.

“Tam going ahead with my plan.” Kwame bid Joseph
goodbye and asked him to mect him at the airport.
There they were going to share the loot and he—
Kwame would be going out of town through the
waterfront. He planned to ditch Joseph when he
turns up for his share at the Airport. He was going to
make it look like suicide. 3

Kwame went into the night and through back
streets, he got to the Eagle Airlines compound. At the
time, the night watchman was nowhere to be found.

He crept in silently like an alley cat and traced his way
to the staircase. He climbed up and went down the
corridor to the manager’s office.

Again with the’skeleton key, he opened the manager’s
office door and fumbled in the dark to where the safe
stood. With a pen-torchlight, he was able to see the
safe’s dial. He expertly handled the safe and as he laid
his hands on the sack of diamonds, there was suddenly a
blinding pool of light and a gritty, iron voice said:
“Hands up!” -

Kwame was flabbergasted. Facing him were four
police detectives with guns in their hands. One of the
detectives brought out a pair of manacles and snapped
it on Kwame wrists. Then he gave Kwame a hot slap
on the face.

Joseph who was taking an anticipatory stroll to the
rendezvous walked into the hands of the police and
along with Kwame was bundled into the police van and
escorted to the station.

JENKINSON AND THE LOCUSTS

By

“JaKIN Kano”

HE ‘Desert’ Locust is distinguishable from other
breeds by the way her wings are held at the
egg-laying instar.”

So ran the rubric of Instructions on Locust Recognition,
which Jenkinson thumbed over wearily. Three battered
lorries loaded with guinea-corn bran and drums of
poison lay in the Works Yard of the Provincial Head-
quarters. Tomorrow he was to take them North to Yo.
Desert Locusts had come to Lake Chad.

“Reporting is vital,” Padgham, the Commissioner,
had said that afternoon as he gave him the briefing,
“I know communications are difficult in the Lake Chad

56

area, but send a messenger to the Telegraph Office with
your report when you can. Keep it brief though.”

Three hundred miles to the North lay Yo. Dusk was
falling at the mud-built rest house. A hundred yards
away lay the green sloping banks of the river, heavy
with crops. Headman Garba hitched his indigo robes
back over his shoulder. He looked at Jenkinson, with

three days’ sand and grime on him.
“Medicine for the locusts!” he exclaimed grimly, as
willing hands unloaded the posion drums,

“You know how to use it?” asked Jenkinson.
“Too well, European,” was the answer. “The whole

Kukawa was founded in a grove of Kuka trees. Al-Kanemi’s palace once stood here

Yero but Gwani Mukhtar stayed on, later being
chased out of the city and killed by a Bornu force.
His son Mamman Manga took over command of
his army.

After his retreat from Gazargamu the Mai first
stayed at Mege for forty days and then went to
Asaga on the Yobe where he remained for nine-
teen months without returning to Gazargamu
although some of the ordinary townspeople came
back to their homes.

After the death of Mukhtar another of the
Sokoto flag bearers raided Bornu. He was Mallam
Zaki whose activities had so far been confined to
Katagum. He was said to be a Bagirmi from the
Shari valley and now he came and took possession
of Gazargamu.

The Mai in despair cast about him forameansof
expelling the Fulani from Bornu. He had already
made the acquaintance of al-Kanemi and now he
asked him for advice. Al-Kanemi now used for
the first time the temporal power which, all
unsought, had fallen to his lot since he came to
Kanem from North Africa. He sent to Kanem and
called up a force of spearmen of the Sugurti and
Kuburi Kanembu. With this backing the Bornu
army was able to advance on Gazargamu and drive
Mallam Zaki out in October 1809. He retreated
with his armies to the west and the Mai was
reinstated in his capital. He was to die very soon
and Mai Dunoma succeeded him. Al-Kanemi
withdrew from the scene and continued his
scholarly peregrinations.

(for Lovett)

All around I see the faces of Eve
adorned to the craft of the artist.

I see them put on smiles and cull

out eyes like watersnails, looking

not at faces but on the ground as if
to say “We want to go unnoticed”
yet wanting to be noticed.

I screen through these faces and look
beyond the craft of the artist;

I see native smiles struggling

beneath layers of lipstick and cheeks
peeping through films of oil and powder,
whispering tenderly “We want

no covering for our desires.” So, so
Baby, I cherish not the craft of face-painting
or smearing lips like Efik carvings.:
No. I want no exhibits on my lips
when in innocence they touch yours.
Not that 1 love to go unnoticed, but,
but why a ransom on the lips

when your eyelashes speak to mez

O. Wonop!

the doors are open all day
you may climb in at night

through the window when:

the night-watch is asleep

you may walk in by the door

at noon when the shopkeeper
is smiling to customers and

plain-clothes watch your moves

the doors are open all day

and whether you enter at night
through the window or by the door
at noon you know your motives

FOR MOTHER

Nene ...the shadows are overgrown
this afternoon in my heart;

the burden of uncertainties assail me _
with a feckless ravish—

I do not know whether to cry or laugh. +

Each day saps me dry

of the red-green that you gave me
in ellipses of hope

to halo my dreams.

Mother, the weal
of your chalked-hand slap - -
tattoes my soul: your wish
that the phallic truth of my being
should sprout out.of the smokes
that house it now. -
But Iam not at peace
with the flutter of selves
that dog my inside
—hiding in banana skins
~—in. the griefof many unknown things,
Tam out of boat with my paddle,
. no one should owe me tears
T want to catapult my love
to you... through these thwarting gales
that toss my dreams to tatters. I want
to pay back in words
the wry story of the smile
that you glutted my lips with, —
(Pardon me, if my sea is too shallow) _

I wish I could re-live the sky
of my time of egrets
by giving you joy.
