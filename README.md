Treebeard - A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to deep research/report generation. This ~~library~~ hack uses MCTS for exploration, identify knowledge gaps, and synthesize findings into comprehensive reports. It combines vector store retrieval with targeted internet searches to gather evidence and optimise information discovery. The ~~algorithm~~ hack balances exploration and exploitation to deliver structured, high-confidence research outputs with citations and source tracking blah blah blah. You get the gist.
